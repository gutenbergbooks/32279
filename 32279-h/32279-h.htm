<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>A MISHAP AND ITS CONSEQUENCES</h3>


<p>"Will you please let me have two cream
cakes?"</p>

<p>The young woman behind the
counter of the small bakery glanced kindly at the
maker of this request, a little girl in a rather neat-looking
dress, with a dark, earnest face and a
pair of big, solemn brown eyes.</p>

<p>"They're nice and fresh to-day," she remarked
pleasantly; "they came out of the oven only an
hour ago."</p>

<p>The customer smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm glad," she said; "my little brother is very
fond of cream cakes."</p>

<p>"And how is your little brother to-day?" the
woman questioned, at the same time selecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8">8</a></span>
three large, fat cream cakes from the heaped up
dish on the counter.</p>

<p>"He's pretty well, thank you. Oh, excuse me,
but you're giving me three; I only asked for
two."</p>

<p>"Never mind about that, it's all right. Too
bad your little brother can't get out these fine
spring days, isn't it?"</p>

<p>A troubled, wistful look came into the child's
face.</p>

<p>"He would like to get out," she said sadly;
"I wish he could."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I don't wonder; it's just grand
in the park these warm afternoons. My two
little boys about live there. If you could take
him out for a drive sometimes, it would do him
a lot of good, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Before the child could answer, the door of the
bakery opened, and two more customers, a lady
and a little girl of nine or ten, came in.</p>

<p>"Well, Winnie," said the lady smiling, as they
approached the counter, "have you decided which
it is to be to-day, macaroons or chocolate
éclairs?"</p>

<p>"I think it had better be éclairs to-day, we
had macaroons three times last week," the little
girl said, laughing, and glancing with an expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9">9</a></span>
of interest at the first customer, who had
now received her package, and was turning to
leave the store. "Oh, mother," she added
eagerly, as the door closed, "did you see? that's
the little girl who lives in our house."</p>

<p>"Was it really?" the lady inquired, looking interested
in her turn; "I didn't notice her."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'm quite sure; I've seen her several
times on the stairs, you know. I wish she hadn't
gone so quick; I should have liked to speak to
her. It seems so queer not to know a person
who lives in the same house that you do, doesn't
it?"</p>

<p>"And a very nice little girl she is too," put in
the young woman behind the counter, glad of an
opportunity to say a good word for one of her
favorite customers. "She often comes in here,
and we serve the family with bread. They live
in the apartment house on the corner."</p>

<p>"That's where we live," said Winifred; "do
you know what the little girl's name is?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it's Randall, Betty Randall; she told me
so herself the other day. Her mother's a very
handsome lady, quite stylish-looking, though I
believe she gives lessons of some kind. She's a
widow, with two children, this one and a little
boy, who is a cripple. It's my opinion they've<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10">10</a></span>
seen better days. Shall I send these things,
ma'am, or will you take them with you?"</p>

<p>"I will take them, thank you. Come, Winifred."</p>

<p>"Mother," said Winifred, as they left the
bakery, "I really do wish I knew that little girl.
She has a very nice face, and if her brother is a
cripple, I might go and read to him sometimes.
You know I'm very fond of cripples."</p>

<p>The lady laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, you may speak to the child, if you like,"
she said kindly. "I scarcely know whether it
would do for you to call on the family. You see,
dear, a great many people live in that big apartment
house, and they may not all be desirable
friends for you. But look, isn't that the very
child you are talking about? Yes, to be sure it
is, and she seems to be in trouble. She must
have had a fall."</p>

<p>A moment later little Betty Randall, standing
in the middle of the sidewalk, gazing disconsolately
down on the débris of her three cream cakes,
which lay crushed and shapeless at her feet, was
startled to hear a sweet, sympathetic voice saying
close to her side:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry; how did it happen?"</p>

<p>"I slipped on a piece of orange peel," explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11">11</a></span>
little Betty, at once recognizing the lady and little
girl she had seen at the baker's, "and fell right on
my bag of cream cakes. They're all spoiled."</p>

<span class="caption">Little Betty Randall gazing disconsolately down on the

</div>

<p>"It's too bad, but hadn't you better go back for
some more?" the lady suggested pleasantly.</p>

<p>Betty hesitated, and her color rose.</p>

<p>"I think not to-day," she said a little primly;
"mother might not like it. I don't mind about
myself," she added quickly, "but I'm sorry for
Jack; he's very fond of cream cakes."</p>

<p>"Is Jack your little brother?" Winifred asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; how did you know I had a little
brother?"</p>

<p>"The woman at the baker's said so, and she
said he was a cripple."</p>

<p>Betty's face softened wonderfully. By this time
they had abandoned the cream cakes to their fate,
and were all three walking on together towards
the big apartment house on the next corner.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is a cripple," she said; "he can't
walk at all. He had a fall when he was a baby,
and it hurt his spine."</p>

<p>"How very sad," said Winifred sympathetically;
"how did it happen?"</p>

<p>"His nurse dropped him one day when mother
and father were out. She didn't tell at first, and
nobody knew what was the matter with Jack, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12">12</a></span>
what made him cry whenever any one touched
him. At last the doctor found out that his spine
was injured, and then she confessed."</p>

<p>"How old is he now?" Winifred inquired.</p>

<p>"He will be nine the day after to-morrow, but
he seems older than that. He's a very clever little
boy; he reads a great deal, and he can draw beautiful
pictures. Mother thinks it's because he is
so much by himself that he gets to be so old-fashioned.
I'm eleven, but I'm not nearly so clever
as Jack."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are very fond of him," said
Winifred. "A person would naturally be very
fond of a brother who is a cripple."</p>

<p>"I love him better than anything else in the
world," said Betty simply.</p>

<p>At that moment the apartment house was
reached.</p>

<p>"Isn't it strange that we live in the same house
and never spoke to each other before?" remarked
Winifred, as they mounted the first flight of stairs
together. "We haven't lived here very long,
though; only since January."</p>

<p>"We have lived here for two years," said Betty,
"and we don't know any of the people in the
house."</p>

<p>Winifred's eyes opened wide in surprise, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13">13</a></span>
they were already on the first landing, and her
mother had rung the bell of their own apartment.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said, "this is where we live.
I hope I shall see you again soon."</p>

<p>Betty stood for a moment gazing at the closed
door, behind which her new acquaintances had
disappeared, and then she toiled on, up three more
long steep flights of stairs, until, on the very top
landing of all, she paused, and taking a key from
her pocket, proceeded to open a door on her right.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Betty?" called an eager little
voice, as the door swung open, and Betty passed
into the small, narrow hall of the "top floor rear
apartment."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; but, oh, Jack, I'm so sorry; I
slipped on a horrid piece of orange peel and
spilled all the cream cakes. It'll have to be cold
meat and bread and butter to-day."</p>

<p>"You didn't hurt yourself, did you?" the anxious
little voice inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not a bit, and quite an interesting
thing happened. Just wait till I take off my hat,
and get your lunch ready, and I'll tell you all about
it."</p>

<p>Five minutes later, Betty, her little dark face
somewhat flushed from recent exertions, but looking,
on the whole, very bright and happy, entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14">14</a></span>
the small front room, bearing a tray containing
milk, cold meat, and a pile of thin bread-and-butter
sandwiches.</p>

<p>"I'll put it on the little table, and we can have
lunch together," she said cheerfully. "See what
a lot of sandwiches mother's made for us."</p>

<p>As she spoke, Betty drew a small table close to
the sofa on which lay the little cripple. Jack
watched her every movement with loving eyes.
Such a pale, wan face as it was; such a poor,
shrunken little body! But it was not a dull face,
and the large, beautiful blue eyes had a bright,
glad light in them, despite the fact that their
owner spent all his poor life confined to a sofa.</p>

<p>"Now tell me about the interesting thing,"
Jack said, when Betty, having completed her arrangements,
had seated herself by his side, prepared
to enjoy the cold meat and bread and butter.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will. It isn't very much, though, only
when I was at the baker's who should happen to
come in but the lady and the little girl who live
down on the second floor. You know, I told you
about that little girl, how pretty she was, and how
she and her mother were always together. I've
seen her mother taking her to school ever so
many mornings, and I think she was on her way
home from school now, for she carried books.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15">15</a></span>
Well, I got my cream cakes&mdash;they were lovely
ones too, and the woman gave me three, though I
only asked for two&mdash;and I was hurrying home as
fast as I could, when all of a sudden I slipped on
that old orange peel, and fell flat. My bag burst
open, and of course the cream cakes were all
squashed. I got up, and was standing looking at
my poor cream cakes, and feeling so dreadfully
sorry, when the lady and the little girl stopped to
speak to me. They were ever so kind. The lady
said I had better go back to the store for more,
but I didn't have money enough for that, you
know."</p>

<p>"You didn't say so, did you?" Jack questioned
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Of course I didn't. I just said I thought I
wouldn't go back to-day, and then we all walked
home together, and the little girl asked me about
you."</p>

<p>"What did you tell her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I said you were a very clever boy, and&mdash;why,
there's the door bell; I wonder who it can
be?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's mother come home early," Jack
suggested, his pale little face brightening; "perhaps
one of her pupils didn't take a lesson, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Betty did not hear. She was already halfway<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16">16</a></span>
across the little hall, and in another moment
was standing with the open door in her hand, gazing
in surprise at the neat, pleasant-faced servant
girl who confronted her. The girl held in her
hand a plate covered with a napkin.</p>

<p>"Is this Miss Betty Randall?" the stranger
inquired, smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Betty, in growing bewilderment.
She was sure she had never seen the girl before.</p>

<p>"Well, here are some éclairs for you. Miss
Winifred Hamilton sends them to you and your
little brother, and hopes you'll both enjoy them."</p>

<p>And before Betty could recover sufficiently from
her surprise to utter a word of either thanks or
protest, the plate was in her hands, and the servant
girl was hurrying away downstairs.</p>

<p>It was with a very bright face, however, that
the little girl came running back into the sitting
room, in answer to Jack's eager "What is it,
Betty?"</p>

<p>"It's éclairs, four beautiful chocolate éclairs,"
she explained joyfully, "and the nice little girl
downstairs has sent them to us.</p>

<p>"She just bought them too, for I heard her
mother asking her at the baker's whether it was
to be éclairs or macaroons, and she said éclairs.
Wasn't it kind of her to send them? You do<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17">17</a></span>
like chocolate éclairs very much, don't you, Jack,
dear?"</p>

<p>"I love them," said Jack heartily, "but, Betty,
do you suppose mother would like it?"</p>

<p>Betty's bright face clouded, but only for a moment.</p>

<p>"I don't believe she'd mind," she said with decision.
"You see, things to eat aren't like money,
and I think it would be rude not to take them when
the little girl was so kind."</p>

<p>Jack acquiesced in this view of the matter, and
the two children were soon in the full enjoyment
of their unexpected treat.</p>

<p>"Her name is Hamilton, Winifred Hamilton,"
remarked Betty, poising a delicious morsel on her
fork as she spoke, "and she knows my name too.
The maid asked if I wasn't Miss Betty Randall.
She is such a pretty little girl, Jack; her hair is
all fluffy and crimpy round her face, and she's got
beautiful eyes."</p>

<p>"I wish I could see her," said Jack wistfully;
"do you suppose she would come up here if you
asked her?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder," said Betty hopefully; "she
said she was very much interested in cripples."</p>

<p>Jack made an impatient movement, and a look
of pain crossed his face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18">18</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I wasn't a cripple," he said, his lip beginning
to tremble; "I wish I could get up and
walk like other people. I want to see things."</p>

<p>Betty laid down her fork, and a look of sympathy
and almost womanly tenderness came into
her eyes.</p>

<p>"What kind of things do you want to see,
Jack?" she asked gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know; all kinds of things. I get
so tired looking out of the window at roofs and
chimneys. I should like to see a park with deer
in it, and swans and a peacock, like the one mother
tells about."</p>

<p>"But you couldn't see that park, you know,
dear, because that was in England, away across
the Atlantic Ocean."</p>

<p>"Well, but there is a park here, too, isn't there?
I heard Mrs. Flynn talking about it the other day.
She said it was beautiful in the park now, with all
the flowers coming out."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, there's Central Park, and it is very
pretty, but not so pretty as the one mother tells
about."</p>

<p>Jack's face brightened again.</p>

<p>"Couldn't I go there some time?" he asked
eagerly; "is it too far for any one to carry me?"</p>

<p>Betty shook her head sadly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's too far for that," she admitted,
"but if we only had a carriage you could go. The
janitor would carry you downstairs, I know, and
it wouldn't be a long drive. I don't believe it
would hurt your back one bit. I'll tell you what,
Jack. Day after to-morrow will be your birthday;
let's ask mother to hire a carriage, and take us
both."</p>

<p>Betty's eyes were sparkling with the sudden inspiration,
but now it was Jack's turn to shake his
head and look dubious.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it would cost too much," he said
mournfully; "I should love it, but I'm really
afraid it would."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it would be so very expensive,"
said hopeful Betty. "There's a livery stable right
across the street, and I'll go over this afternoon
and find out how much it costs. I've got a dollar
and five cents in my bank; I counted it last night,
and mother says it's all mine, to do just what I
please with. Oh, Jack, dear, I'm sure it can't cost
more than a dollar, and I should just love to get
it for your birthday present. I wonder why we
were all so stupid as never to have thought of
doing it before."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>BETTY'S TEMPTATION</h3>

<p>It was about an hour later when Betty, having
washed and put away the luncheon dishes,
and settled Jack with his story book and
drawing materials, ran lightly down the three
long flights of stairs to the Hamiltons' apartment.
In one hand she carried Mrs. Hamilton's plate
and napkin, and in the other a small tin money
box, which jingled at every step. At the Hamiltons'
front door she paused, and rather timidly
rang the bell. The door was opened by the same
girl who had brought the éclairs.</p>

<p>"I came to bring back the plate," Betty explained,
"and will you please tell Miss Winifred
Hamilton that my little brother and I enjoyed
the cakes very much."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to come in and speak to her
yourself?" the girl asked pleasantly; "she's right
here."</p>

<p>She moved aside as she spoke, and there, sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21">21</a></span>
enough, was Winifred standing smiling in the
parlor door.</p>

<p>"Yes, do come in," said the little girl hospitably.
"Mother's out, but I stayed at home to
make a dress for one of my children. They're
really my <i>dolls</i>, you know," she added, smiling at
Betty's look of bewilderment, "but I always call
them my children. I'm so very fond of them, you
see, and they do seem something like real children.
Come in and I'll show them to you."</p>

<p>There was no declining this tempting invitation,
and Betty was soon making the acquaintance of
Winifred's family, and being introduced respectively
to Lord Fauntleroy, Rose-Florence, Violet-May,
Lily-Bell, and Miss Mollie.</p>

<p>"You see, when my father and mother were
away in California I used to be alone a good deal,"
Winifred explained, "and so if it hadn't been for
the children I should have been rather lonely. I
lived with Uncle Will and Aunt Estelle then, and
Aunt Estelle is a very busy lady and has to go
out a good deal. My mother hardly ever goes
out without me, and I don't have nearly so much
time to devote to the children as I used, but I
shouldn't like to have them feel neglected, so
sometimes I stay at home on purpose to look after
them a little."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22">22</a></span></p>

<p>"How old are you?" Betty inquired. To her
this conversation seemed extremely childish. She
had never had much time in her busy little life to
care for dolls, Jack having claimed all her thought
and attention.</p>

<p>"I shall be ten next July, so as it's April now,
father says I'm nine and three-quarters. Father's
very fond of joking, and so is Uncle Will."</p>

<p>"You go to school, don't you?" Betty
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I go to Miss Lothrop's. I was coming
from school when I met you to-day. Mother
almost always takes me and comes for me herself,
because we have only Lizzie, and she has a great
deal to do."</p>

<p>"We don't keep any girl at all now," said Betty,
"and so I can't go to school, because there would
be nobody to take care of Jack. We did keep a
girl last year, but some of mother's pupils gave
up, and she couldn't get any new ones, so we had
to let her go. Mother gives us our lessons every
afternoon when she comes home, and we study in
the mornings by ourselves."</p>

<p>"Is your mother a teacher?" Winifred inquired
with interest.</p>

<p>"Yes, she gives music lessons, and she plays
beautifully too. We have a piano, because Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23">23</a></span>
loves music so, and mother plays to him almost
every evening."</p>

<p>"I guess cripples always like music," said Winifred
reflectively. "Mr. Bradford had a lovely
music box; it played twelve tunes."</p>

<p>"Who is Mr. Bradford?"</p>

<p>"He was a crippled gentleman I used to know.
He was very kind, and I loved him very much. I
used to read to him, and he liked it. He died last
winter."</p>

<p>"Some cripples are quite strong in other ways,
you know," Betty hastened to explain. Winifred's
remark about dying had made her vaguely uncomfortable.
"Jack isn't nearly so delicate as he used
to be. I think if he could only get out in the fresh
air sometimes he would be ever so much better."</p>

<p>"Doesn't he ever go out?"</p>

<p>"No. You see, he can't walk at all, and he's
too heavy to carry far. It's awfully hard for him
never to see anything but chimneys. Our apartment
is in the rear, so he can't even see the trolley
cars."</p>

<p>"Why don't you take him for a drive sometimes?"
Winifred asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>Betty's eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"That's just what I'm going to do," she said
triumphantly. "I never thought of it till to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24">24</a></span>
but first the woman at the baker's spoke of it,
and then Jack said he wished he could see Central
Park. The day after to-morrow will be his birthday,
and I'm going to hire a carriage and take him
for a nice drive. I'm going to pay for it out of
my own money too; it's to be my birthday present."</p>

<p>"That will be nice," said Winifred in a tone of
satisfaction. "Does he know about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and he's so pleased. I'm going right
over to the livery stable now to ask how much it
will cost. It couldn't be more than a dollar, do
you think it could?"</p>

<p>Winifred, whose ideas on the subject were quite
as vague as Betty's own, and to whom a dollar
appeared a rather large sum, replied that she was
sure it couldn't, and after a little more conversation
Betty departed on her errand.</p>

<p>With a beating heart the little girl crossed the
street and entered the office of the livery stable on
the opposite corner. A man was writing at a desk,
but he looked up at her entrance, and laid down
his pen.</p>

<p>"Well, miss, what can I do for you?" he inquired
politely, as Betty paused, uncertain in just
what words to put her request. "Do you want
a cab?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25">25</a></span></p>

<p>"No, thank you," said Betty, "at least not to-day,
but I think I shall want one the day after
to-morrow. Would you please tell me how much
it would cost to hire a carriage to take us to Central
Park?"</p>

<p>The man glanced at a big book which lay open
on the desk before him.</p>

<p>"Central Park," he repeated, beginning to turn
over the pages, "that would mean an afternoon
drive, of course. Our regular charge for an afternoon
drive is five dollars."</p>

<p>"Five dollars!" Betty gave a little gasp. "I
didn't know it would be so expensive," she said,
and without another word she turned and walked
quickly out of the office.</p>

<p>But once outside she did not hurry. Very
slowly she recrossed the street, entered at the familiar
door, and began climbing the long flights
of stairs. At the top of the first flight she was
stopped by her new friend Winifred.</p>

<p>"I was watching for you," Winifred explained;
"I wanted to know if it was all right about the
carriage. Oh, what's the matter? Didn't you get
it, after all?"</p>

<p>Betty shook her head; she could not speak just
then, but all the bright look of pride and happiness
had gone out of her face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26">26</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry," said Winifred sympathetically.
"Were the carriages all engaged for the
day after to-morrow? Perhaps you could get one
at some other stable."</p>

<p>"It isn't that," said Betty, trying hard to steady
the quiver in her voice, "but&mdash;but they were very
expensive&mdash;much more expensive than I thought.
We couldn't possibly have one."</p>

<p>"How much are they?" Winifred inquired
with interest.</p>

<p>"Five dollars, the man said."</p>

<p>"Oh!" and Winifred's eyes opened wide in
astonishment; "that is a great deal of money.
Uncle Will gave me a five-dollar gold-piece for
Easter, and we thought it was very good of him.
But if your little brother wants to go so very
much, and if it's his birthday, don't you think
your mother might possibly let you have the
money?"</p>

<p>But Betty shook her head decidedly. "She
couldn't possibly," she said, "I know she
couldn't." And then all at once her forced
composure gave way, and she burst into
tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll be so disappointed, so dreadfully
disappointed," she sobbed. "Oh, I wish I had
never said anything about it to him, but I was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27">27</a></span>
sure a dollar would be enough, and I promised
him&mdash;I promised him."</p>

<p>It was some few minutes later when Betty, still
with red eyes, but otherwise looking much as
usual, reached the top landing and paused for a
moment outside their own door. Jack was so
happy; how could she tell him that their cherished
plan must be given up? She gave a long sigh, and
drawing the door-key from her pocket, was in the
act of fitting it in the lock when she heard the
sound of footsteps and rustling skirts just behind
her, and, turning in surprise, caught sight
of a rather stout, florid lady coming up the
stairs.</p>

<p>"This is the top floor, isn't it?" the stranger
inquired rather breathlessly, as she reached the
landing. She was not accustomed to climbing
stairs, and did not enjoy it.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Betty politely.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm thankful to hear it, I'm sure. I
never had such a climb in my life. It's an outrage
not to have elevators in these high buildings. Can
you tell me which is Mrs. Randall's apartment?"</p>

<p>"It's this one," said Betty, looking very much
surprised, for she was sure she had never seen
the lady before, "but Mrs. Randall is out. I'm
her little girl; I could take any message."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28">28</a></span></p>

<p>The lady drew a step back, and stood regarding
Betty with keen, though kindly scrutiny.</p>

<p>"So you are Mrs. Randall's little girl," she
said; "I remember she told me she had children.
Well, I suppose I shall have to leave my message
with you, though I am sorry not to see her myself,
if only to say good-bye."</p>

<p>"Won't you come in?" said Betty. "Mother
will be at home pretty soon, I think; she generally
gets back by four."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I couldn't possibly spare the time; my
carriage is waiting, and I have no end of things
to attend to this afternoon. Will you tell your
mother that Mrs. Martin called? Mrs. Henry
Martin. Perhaps you may have heard her speak
of me."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Betty eagerly; "mother gives
music lessons to your two little boys."</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure she does, and that is the very
thing I wanted to see her about. My husband has
suddenly decided to go to Europe on business, and
we are all going with him. It was arranged only
last evening, and we sail next Saturday. I hate
to take the children off like this right in the middle
of the quarter, and that is why I wanted to come
and see your mother about it rather than write
her a note. It really can't be helped, and I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29">29</a></span>
she will understand. Ask her, please, to let me
have her bill, and she needn't trouble to come
again; the children will be too busy to take any
more lessons before we sail."</p>

<p>"I'll tell mother," said Betty; "she'll be sorry
not to have seen you herself."</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin was turning away, but she glanced
once more at Betty's pale little face, and then, as
if with a sudden thought, she paused and drew
out her purse.</p>

<p>"My little boys are very fond of your mother,"
she said kindly. "They mind her better than
they ever minded any other teacher they had, and
their father and I are both much pleased with her
methods. I hope that another winter&mdash;but one
never knows what may happen. Here's a little
present for you, dear; buy something nice for
yourself with it."</p>

<p>As she spoke, Mrs. Martin held out her hand,
and in it there was a bill. Betty saw it distinctly;
a crisp, new five-dollar bill.</p>

<p>For one breathless, delicious moment, the little
girl wavered, while her heart beat so fast that she
could scarcely breathe, and all the blood in her
body seemed to come surging up into her face and
neck. Impulsively, she held out her hand. Another
second and her fingers would have closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30">30</a></span>
upon the tempting gift. Suddenly her hand
dropped to her side, and all the color died out of
her face again, leaving it even paler than before.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," she said in a low, unsteady
voice; "thank you very much, but&mdash;but
mother doesn't like to have us take money."</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin looked surprised, even a little annoyed.
For a moment she seemed inclined to dispute
the point, but seeing the child's evident embarrassment
and distress, changed her mind.</p>

<p>"Very well, dear," she said good-naturedly.
"I am sorry you won't take my present, but you
are right not to do anything of which your mother
would disapprove. When we come back next
autumn you must get your mother to bring you to
see us some time. Now good-bye. You won't
forget my message, will you?"</p>

<p>Jack was watching anxiously for his sister's
return. At the familiar sound of the latch-key he
raised himself on his elbow, straining his eyes for
the first glimpse of Betty's face.</p>

<p>"Well, is it all right?" he cried eagerly; "are
we going to have the carriage? Oh, Betty, it
isn't; I see it in your eyes."</p>

<p>Betty said nothing, but going over to the sofa,
sat down beside her little brother, slipping her arm
lovingly about him. Jack winked hard and bit his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31">31</a></span>
lip, but he, too, was silent after that first exclamation.
Perhaps even Betty herself did not realize
how keen this disappointment was to the little
cripple. In a few moments Betty spoke.</p>

<p>"It was five dollars," she said.</p>

<p>"Five dollars!" repeated Jack incredulously.
"Oh, Betty, what a lot of money! Mother could
never spare all that at once."</p>

<p>"I could have had it, though," said Betty,
speaking fast and nervously. "I could have had
every bit of it. A lady was coming to see mother;
I met her on the stairs. Mother gives her little
boys music lessons, and she came to say they are
all going to Europe next week. She was very
kind; she said she wanted to give me a present,
and she offered me a five-dollar bill."</p>

<p>Jack gasped, and two red spots glowed in his
cheeks.</p>

<p>"You didn't take it, did you?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to," said Betty slowly; "I wanted
to very much. I was just going to take it in my
hand, and then I remembered how mother would
feel, and I didn't."</p>

<p>Jack heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you didn't," he said rather tremulously.</p>

<p>Again there was silence. Both children were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32">32</a></span>
trying hard to keep back the coming tears. Again
Betty was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"I suppose some mothers wouldn't mind their
children taking presents," she said. "I wonder
why mother is so very particular?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know?" Jack's blue eyes
opened wide in surprise. "It's because we're
English, and mother once lived in that beautiful
place with the park and the deer. She can't forget
about it, even if she is poor now. She has to
remember she's a lady, and ladies never do take
money from strangers."</p>

<p>Betty sighed impatiently.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's wrong," she said, "but sometimes
I can't help wishing mother hadn't been
quite such a grand person when she lived in England.
What's the use of it now when we have to
live in a flat, and mother has to give music lessons
and do all the housework herself? If she hadn't
had all those beautiful things once, she wouldn't
mind so much about being poor now."</p>

<p>"Well, but it's nice to have the other things to
think about," said Jack. "Aren't you glad you've
got ancestors?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I care very much," said practical
Betty; "I'd rather have relations that are
alive now. Winifred Hamilton said her uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33">33</a></span>
gave her a five-dollar gold-piece for Easter. I
wish we had an uncle, don't you?"</p>

<p>"We have got Uncle Jack," said Jack thoughtfully,
"but we don't know where he is, and mother
doesn't like to have us ask her about him. There's
the door bell, and it's mother's ring. Wait one
minute, Betty, please. Don't say anything to her
about the carriage; she'd be so sorry to think we
were disappointed, you know."</p>

<p>"No, I won't," said Betty emphatically.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34">34</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>WINIFRED'S THANK OFFERING</h3>

<p>"Mother, dear, I want to talk to you
about something very important."</p>

<p>"Well, my pet, what is it?" And
Mrs. Hamilton laid aside her book, and took her
little daughter into her lap.</p>

<p>It was the hour before dinner; the time of day
that Winifred always liked best, because then her
mother was never busy, and was quite ready to tell
her stories, play games, or discuss any subject
under the sun.</p>

<p>"It's about a story I've been reading," said
Winifred, nestling her head comfortably on her
mother's shoulder. "It's a lovely story, all about
a little boy who was stolen and had to act in a
circus and live in a caravan. He had a very hard
time, but in the end his father and mother found
him, and they were so happy that his father built
a hospital for poor children just to show how
grateful he was. He called it a Thank Offering."</p>

<p>Winifred paused to give a long, contented<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35">35</a></span>
glance about the pretty, comfortable room. Her
mother softly stroked the fluffy little head resting
against her shoulder. She knew there was more
to come.</p>

<p>"Well," Winifred went on after a moment,
"I've been thinking a great deal about that story.
You see, I think I feel very much the way those
people did. Since you and father came home from
California, and we came here to live, I've been so
very, very happy. I say a little prayer to God
about it sometimes, but I think I should like to do
something for a Thank Offering too."</p>

<p>"What would you like to do?" Mrs. Hamilton
asked, stooping to kiss the sweet, earnest little
face.</p>

<p>"Well, I've been thinking about that, and it
seems as if the best thing would be to make some
one else very happy. You know the five-dollar
gold-piece that Uncle Will gave me for
Easter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Well, do you think he would mind very much
if I spent it all on giving somebody else a good
time?"</p>

<p>"He would not mind in the least, I am sure,
but I thought you had decided to buy a bracelet
just like Lulu Bell's."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36">36</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I had; but, you see, that was before I
began to think about the Thank Offering."</p>

<p>"Well, and when did you first begin to think
of the Thank Offering?" Mrs. Hamilton asked,
smiling.</p>

<p>"It was yesterday afternoon, when Betty Randall
was so disappointed because the man at the
livery stable told her it would cost five dollars for
a carriage to take her little brother for a drive.
I've been thinking about it ever since, and to-day
at recess I told Lulu, and she thinks just the same
as I do."</p>

<p>"You mean that you would like to spend your
five dollars in hiring a carriage to take that little
cripple boy and his sister for a drive?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; do you think I might? I don't
know the little boy yet, but I like Betty very
much, and she was so disappointed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton was looking both pleased and
interested.</p>

<p>"I do think you might," she said heartily,
"and, Winnie, dear, I like your idea of a Thank
Offering very much indeed. I have been thinking
a good deal about that poor child myself ever
since what you told me yesterday. Didn't you say
to-morrow would be the little boy's birthday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow; and to-morrow will be Saturday<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37">37</a></span>
too. Oh, mother, dear, do you really think
we could?"</p>

<p>"I will go up and call on Mrs. Randall this
evening," said Mrs. Hamilton with decision. "I
have never met her, but I like her little girl's appearance
very much. I don't believe she will have
any objection to letting the children go with us.
There's father's key. Run and open the door for
him and give him a nice kiss."</p>

<p>It was about half-past eight that evening when
Mrs. Hamilton left her own apartment and
climbed the three flights of stairs to the top floor.
On the last landing she paused to get her breath
before ringing the Randalls' bell, and at that moment
her ear caught the sound of music. Some
one was playing on the piano, and playing in a
way that at once attracted Mrs. Hamilton's attention.
This was not the kind of music she was
accustomed to hearing through open windows or
thin walls. Mrs. Hamilton had studied music
herself under some of the best teachers the city
could produce, and she knew at once that this was
no ordinary musician. She had heard that Mrs.
Randall gave music lessons, but she had never expected
anything like this.</p>

<p>She stood quite still, listening until the piece
came to an end, and then as the last notes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38">38</a></span>
beautiful nocturne died away, she raised her head
and lightly touched the electric bell. The door
was opened by the same little girl she had seen the
day before.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," said the visitor, smiling
pleasantly, "is your mother at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Betty, looking very much surprised,
but standing aside to let the lady pass;
"she's in the parlor playing to Jack."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton crossed the narrow hall, and
entered the small but very neat-looking parlor.
She noticed at a glance the plants in the window;
the canary in his gilt cage, and the little crippled
boy lying on the sofa. Jack's face was flushed
with pleasure, and his blue eyes, full of sweet
content, rested lovingly on the figure of the lady
at the piano. At the sight of the unexpected
visitor the lady rose.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Betty eagerly, "it's Mrs. Hamilton&mdash;Winifred
Hamilton's mother."</p>

<p>A slight flush rose in Mrs. Randall's cheeks,
but her greeting, though perhaps a little formal,
was perfectly courteous. Mrs. Hamilton saw at
a glance that the woman at the baker's had not
exaggerated when she had described Betty's
mother as "a very handsome lady." She was
very tall and stately, and she spoke in a low, refined<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39">39</a></span>
voice. Her eyes were large and dark, and
there was a look in them that seemed to tell of
suffering&mdash;a look that went straight to Mrs.
Hamilton's kind heart.</p>

<p>It was impossible for any one to remain long ill
at ease in the society of sweet, genial Mrs. Hamilton,
and in five minutes the two ladies were chatting
pleasantly together, and Mrs. Randall had
almost ceased to wonder why her neighbor should
have intruded upon her at this unseasonable hour.
Mrs. Hamilton made friends with Jack in a
way that won his heart at once, and Betty sat
watching her with frank admiration. At last the
visitor said:</p>

<p>"And now I must really explain my reason for
troubling you at this time of the evening, Mrs.
Randall. My little Winifred has taken a great
fancy to your Betty, and is most anxious to make
the acquaintance of Jack as well. She and I are
going for a drive in the park to-morrow afternoon,
and I have come to ask you if you will
allow Betty and Jack to go with us."</p>

<p>The color deepened in Mrs. Randall's face, and
she began to be a little formal again.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," she began politely, "but
I am afraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A low exclamation from both children checked<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40">40</a></span>
the words on her lips, and she glanced anxiously
from one eager little face to the other. Betty was
actually pale with suppressed excitement, and
Jack's blue eyes said unutterable things.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid to trust Jack to us,"
Mrs. Hamilton went on, just as if she had not
heard her hostess's courteous words; "the janitor
can carry him up and down stairs, and I promise
to take the very best care of him."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," Mrs. Randall said again,
and this time there was more warmth in her tone.
"The children would enjoy it immensely, I
know. You would like to go, wouldn't you, Jack,
darling?"</p>

<p>"Like it! Oh, mother, I should love it better
than anything in the world."</p>

<p>Of course there was no more hesitation after
that, and when Mrs. Hamilton went downstairs
ten minutes later, it was to tell Winifred the good
news that Mrs. Randall had given her consent,
and that the carriage was to be ordered for three
o'clock the following afternoon.</p>

<p>"I rather like Mrs. Randall," Mrs. Hamilton
said to her husband when Winifred had slipped
away to her room, to tell her children all about
her Thank Offering; "she is a lady, one can see
that at once, and, oh, Phil, she was playing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41">41</a></span>
piano when I went upstairs. I haven't heard
such music in years. I think she has seen better
days, and is inclined to resent anything that seems
like patronage. There is a look in her eyes that
somehow made my heart ache."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall was very silent for some time
after her visitor had left. She closed the piano,
and went away to sit by herself in her dark little
bedroom, leaving the children to chatter over the
delightful prospect for the morrow, and when she
came back to put Jack to bed, her eyes looked as if
she had been crying.</p>

<p>"Mother," whispered the little boy, laying his
cheek softly against his mother's as she bent to
give him a last good-night kiss, "you aren't sorry
you said yes, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, darling," she answered tenderly; "I can
never be sorry about anything that gives my little
boy pleasure, but, oh, Jack dear, I wish I had the
money to take you myself."</p>

<p>Betty's first action on waking the next morning
was to rush to the window to ascertain the state
of the weather.</p>

<p>"It's perfectly lovely, Jack," she announced
joyfully, running from the room she shared with
her mother into the tiny one Jack occupied. "The
sun is shining as bright as can be, there isn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42">42</a></span>
a cloud in the sky. Here's your birthday present;
it's only a box of drawing pencils, but I couldn't
go far enough to buy anything else yesterday, and
I thought you'd like it."</p>

<p>Jack, who was already sitting up in bed, hugging
a new story book, assured his sister that
drawing pencils were the very things he most
wanted.</p>

<p>"And see what mother gave me," he added,
holding up the new book for Betty's inspection,
"'The Boys of Seventy-six.' Oh, Betty, I do
think birthdays are lovely things, don't you?"</p>

<p>That was a busy morning for the Randalls.
Being Saturday, there were no lessons for Mrs.
Randall to give, but there was all the weekly
house-cleaning to be done, and Betty and her
mother worked steadily until luncheon time. If
Mrs. Randall had ancestors, she had also plenty
of good common sense. She was not too proud to
work for her little ones, however unwilling she
might be to accept favors for them from others,
and she plied broom and mop to such good purpose
that by twelve o'clock the little home was the very
picture of neatness and order. Jack lay on the
sofa as usual, too happy in eager anticipations for
the afternoon to forget them even in the interest
of his new story book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43">43</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Randall went out for a little while after
luncheon, returning with a pretty blue sailor cap
for Jack. The thought had suddenly occurred to
Betty that her brother possessed no outdoor garments,
and for a moment she was filled with dismay,
but her mother assured her that, with the
aid of her own long cape and the new sailor cap,
the little boy would do very well indeed.</p>

<p>"I wish I had time to finish your new dress
though, dear," she said, glancing regretfully at
the darn in Betty's skirt. "I tried to do it last
night, but my eyes hurt me, and I was afraid to
work any longer."</p>

<p>"I don't mind one bit," declared Betty, remembering
to have wakened in the night just as the
clock was striking twelve, and found her mother's
place in bed still empty. "I think this dress is
nice enough, and I'm sure Mrs. Hamilton and
Winifred are too kind to care about what people
wear."</p>

<p>"I care though," said Mrs. Randall with a sigh;
"I should like to have people think that my little
girl was a lady."</p>

<p>"Well, if I behave nicely and am ladylike,
won't they think so any way?" inquired Betty innocently.
At which her mother smiled in spite
of herself, and gave her a kiss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44">44</a></span></p>

<p>At three o'clock precisely there was a ring at
the door bell, and Mrs. Hamilton appeared. She
was closely followed by Mr. Jones, the good-natured
janitor, who lifted Jack in his strong arms
and carried him downstairs as easily as if he had
been a baby. Mrs. Randall accompanied the party
to the sidewalk, and stood by, watching anxiously
while the little cripple was placed carefully
and tenderly on the seat of the comfortable carriage
Mrs. Hamilton had procured. She looked
so sad and wistful that kind Mrs. Hamilton
longed to ask her to take her place in the carriage,
but dared not, lest in doing so she might arouse
her neighbor's sensitive pride.</p>

<p>At last all was ready, Mrs. Hamilton and the
two little girls were in their places, and the carriage
moved slowly away from the door.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, mother, dear," cried Jack, waving
his thin little hand as he leaned comfortably back
among his pillows; "I'm having such a lovely,
lovely time."</p>

<p>There were tears in Mrs. Randall's dark eyes
as she turned away, and when she had gone back
to her own rooms, instead of at once settling down
to her afternoon's sewing, she threw herself wearily
upon Jack's sofa and buried her face in the
pillows with a sob.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45">45</a></span></p>

<p>What a drive that was! I don't think any one
of those four people will ever forget it.</p>

<p>"It was one of the loveliest experiences I
ever had in my life, Phil," Mrs. Hamilton told her
husband that evening with tears in her eyes. "To
see that dear little fellow's wonder and delight
over the very simplest things was enough to
make one ashamed of ever having been dissatisfied
with one's lot or discontented about anything.
I never before in my life saw any one so
perfectly happy."</p>

<p>It was pretty to see the devotion of the two little
girls to the poor crippled boy.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure you're comfortable,
Jack?" Winifred kept asking over and over
again, while Betty looked anxiously into her
brother's radiant face to make sure he was not
getting tired.</p>

<p>It was a glorious spring afternoon, and the park
had never looked more lovely. How Jack enjoyed
it no words could describe.</p>

<p>"I don't believe mother's park was any more
beautiful than this one," he said to Betty, as, in
answer to a direction from Mrs. Hamilton the
coachman turned the horses to go round a second
time. "I haven't seen any deer, but there are
sheep and swans."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46">46</a></span></p>

<p>"Where's your mother's park?" Winifred inquired,
with pardonable curiosity.</p>

<p>Betty blushed and gave her brother a warning
glance. Jack looked as if he had said something
he was sorry for.</p>

<p>"It's a story mother tells us," he explained,
"about a park she used to see when she lived in
England. It was a beautiful park, and we love to
hear about it."</p>

<p>"My friend Lulu Bell's father and mother used
to live in England," said Winifred, "and she went
there with them once for a visit. Did you ever
live there?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Betty, Jack's attention having
been called off for the moment by the sight of
some new wonder, "father and mother came to
this country before we were born."</p>

<p>"Has your father been long dead, dear?" Mrs.
Hamilton asked kindly.</p>

<p>"He died six years ago, when I was only five.
I don't remember him very well, and Jack doesn't
remember him at all. Oh, Jack, look at that carriage
without any horses. That's an automobile."</p>

<p>It was nearly five o'clock before the carriage
again drew up before the door of the big apartment
house, and Mr. Jones came out and once
more lifted Jack in his arms to carry him upstairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47">47</a></span></p>

<p>There was a tinge of bright color on the little
boy's usually pale cheeks and his eyes were
shining.</p>

<p>"I've had the most beautiful time I ever had in
my life," he said, turning to Mrs. Hamilton with
a radiant smile. "You've been so very kind, and
so has Winifred, and&mdash;and, please, I'd like to
kiss you both."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>GATHERING CLOUDS</h3>

<p>"Oh, dear! I do wish it would stop raining,"
sighed Betty, glancing out of the
window one wet afternoon a few days
later. "It's rained just as hard as it can for two
whole days, and it doesn't look a bit more like
clearing now than it did yesterday morning."</p>

<p>"I hope mother won't take any more cold,"
said Jack, rather anxiously, pausing in his task of
endeavoring to draw a sketch from memory of an
automobile. "She coughed dreadfully last night;
it woke me up. I wish she didn't have to go out
on rainy days."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Betty decidedly. "Don't you
hate being poor, Jack?"</p>

<p>"If you were only grown up," Jack went on,
ignoring his sister's question, "you could go out
and give the lessons on wet days or when mother
didn't feel well, and she could stay at home and
rest."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49">49</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I couldn't," said Betty, dolefully. "You
know I'm not a bit musical; I couldn't play like
mother if I tried all my life. I don't see how
I'm ever going to be any kind of a teacher if I
can't go to school and get a diploma. People
can't teach without diplomas; Mrs. Flynn says
so. Her daughter's trying for one this year."</p>

<p>"Well, you would be able to do something any
way," Jack maintained, "and mother wouldn't
have to work so dreadfully hard. I wish you
were grown up, Betty, only then I should have to
be grown up too, and I shouldn't like that."</p>

<p>"Why not?" inquired Betty in some surprise.</p>

<p>Jack flushed, and turned his face towards the
wall.</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly," he stammered, "but I
think&mdash;I'm sure it must be much worse to be a
grown up cripple, than to be a little boy one."</p>

<p>Betty left her seat by the window, and coming
over to her brother's side, sat down on the end of
the sofa by Jack's feet.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't mind so much if you could be
a great artist and paint beautiful pictures, would
you, Jack?" she asked gently.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, I don't suppose I should, not quite so
much, because then I could sell my pictures, and
make lots of money for you and mother. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50">50</a></span>
we could live in a lovely place in the country, and
keep a carriage."</p>

<p>"And you could go to drive every day," added
Betty, falling in at once with Jack's fancy, "and
mother could have a fine piano, and go to hear all
the concerts and operas. Then we could give
money to poor people instead of having people
want to give it to us, and I could be very accomplished,
and go to parties sometimes."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jack eagerly, "and some time we
could all go to England, and see the place where
mother used to live."</p>

<p>Betty looked a little doubtful.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether mother would like that
or not," she said. "You see, when mother lived
there she knew father, and now he's dead. It
might make her feel badly to go back."</p>

<p>"So it might; I never thought about that, but
she might like to see Uncle Jack. I should like to
see him, shouldn't you, Betty?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I wonder if we ever shall. Mother
doesn't like to have us talk much about him, but
I know she loves him very much; her eyes always
look that way when she tells us how handsome
and splendid he used to be when he was a
boy."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be nice if Winifred Hamilton<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51">51</a></span>
came to see us this afternoon," Jack remarked
rather irrelevantly; "I do like her very much,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she's lovely; she said she'd come to see
you some day."</p>

<p>"We haven't seen her since the day we went
for the drive. Perhaps she's waiting for you to
call on her first."</p>

<p>"Mother won't let me go," said Betty regretfully;
"she says she's afraid Mrs. Hamilton
might not want Winifred to know us."</p>

<p>"But if she hadn't wanted to know us she
wouldn't have taken us to drive, would she?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think so, but, any way, mother
won't let me go there till Winifred has been here."</p>

<p>"There's the clock striking four," exclaimed
Jack joyfully; "mother'll be in in a few minutes
now. Why don't you light the gas stove, Betty,
and get her slippers nice and warm? She'll be
so tired and wet."</p>

<p>"I will," said Betty, springing up with alacrity;
"and I'll make her a cup of tea, too; she'll
like that." And away bustled the little housewife,
disappointment and vexation alike forgotten
in the pleasant prospect of making mother comfortable.</p>

<p>She had scarcely finished her preparations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52">52</a></span>
the kettle was just beginning to boil, when the
familiar ring was heard, and she flew to open the
door.</p>

<p>Jack was quite correct in his predictions; Mrs.
Randall was both wet and tired. Indeed, she
came in looking so much more tired than usual
that Betty noticed it, and inquired anxiously as
she hung up the dripping umbrella, and helped
her mother off with her waterproof, "Have you
got a headache, mother, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I have a bad headache. My cold
is rather bad, too; I have been coughing a great
deal to-day. Is Jack all right?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; he ate a good lunch, and was reading
all the morning, and drawing pictures all the
afternoon."</p>

<p>"How chilly it feels here," Mrs. Randall said,
shivering and coughing as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I've lighted the stove, and your slippers are
nice and warm," said Betty proudly. "The
kettle's boiling too, and I'll have a nice cup of tea
for you in five minutes."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall's tired face brightened, and she
looked rather relieved.</p>

<p>"That is good," she said. "Hurry as quickly
as you can with the tea, dear, for I believe I am
really chilled through."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53">53</a></span></p>

<p>Betty, nothing loath, flew about like a small
whirlwind; had her mother's wet shoes off and
the warm slippers in their place; drew the comfortable
armchair as near as possible to the steam
radiator, and darted away to the kitchen, from
whence she returned in a twinkling, with a cup
of steaming tea.</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall drank the tea, but though she
pronounced it delicious, and declared herself ever
so much better, she still shivered, and cowered
over the radiator for warmth. Jack watched
her anxiously, with a troubled look on his pale
little face.</p>

<p>In a little while Mrs. Randall rose.</p>

<p>"I think I will go and lie down," she said, and
the children noticed that her voice was very
hoarse. "My head is bad, and if I could sleep for
half an hour I might be all right. Be sure and
call me in time to get dinner, Betty."</p>

<p>"I hope mother isn't going to be ill," said Jack
anxiously, when they were once more alone together.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess not," said cheerful Betty; "she's
only got a cold and a headache. She'll be better
after she's rested. Let's play a game of
lotto."</p>

<p>Jack assented, but though they played several<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54">54</a></span>
games, and Betty did her best to be entertaining,
the troubled expression did not leave his face.
Suddenly he stopped short in the middle of a
game.</p>

<p>"Hear mother coughing, Betty; she can't be
asleep. I wish you'd go and see if she wants
anything."</p>

<p>Betty rose promptly, and hurried into the little
bedroom. Her mother was lying on her bed,
with flushed cheeks and wide-open eyes. At
sight of her little girl she smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"I'm getting nice and warm now, dear," she
said; "that tea did me so much good. I'm going
to get up very soon."</p>

<p>"You look ever so much better," said Betty in
a tone of decided relief. "You've got a lovely
color in your cheeks."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall pressed her hand to her forehead,
but said nothing, and next moment a violent
spasm of coughing shook her from head to
foot.</p>

<p>The evening that followed was a decidedly uncomfortable
one. Mrs. Randall's cough was very
painful, and although she went about as usual,
and tried to appear like herself, it was easy to see
that every movement cost her an effort. Betty
noticed that she scarcely tasted any dinner, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55">55</a></span>
Jack's eyes never left her face. Almost as soon
as dinner was over Jack said he was tired, and
would like to go to bed. The others soon followed,
and by nine o'clock the lights were out,
and the little family settled for the night.</p>

<p>But there was little sleep for at least two members
of the household. Mrs. Randall coughed incessantly,
and tossed from side to side in feverish
restlessness. Betty lay with wide-open eyes, and
a heavier heart than she had ever known before.
It was all very well to assure Jack that there was
not much the matter with mother, and that she
would surely be all right in the morning. She
knew nothing about illness, but she could not help
thinking that that dreadful cough and those
burning hands meant something more than an
every-day cold.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am disturbing you very much,
dear," Mrs. Randall said at last, when the clock
struck ten, and a restless movement on Betty's
part assured her that the child was still wide
awake. "I wish I could be quieter, but this
cough&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind, mother, I'm not one bit sleepy.
I'm really not. Wouldn't you like to have me get
you some water or something?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, darling; I'm afraid it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56">56</a></span>
wouldn't do any good, but if you are not asleep
I should like to talk to you a little."</p>

<p>Betty took one of the hot hands in both her
little cool ones, and patted it gently. After
another fit of coughing, her mother went
on.</p>

<p>"You are only a little girl, Betty, but you are
very sensible, and in many ways seem older than
you really are. There are some things that I
think you ought to know about, in case anything
should ever happen to me."</p>

<p>"But nothing is going to happen, is it,
mother?" Betty asked in a rather frightened
whisper. They both spoke in whispers, so as
not to disturb Jack in the next room.</p>

<p>"No, no, dear, of course not; I only said 'in
case.' I am sure I shall be all right in the morning,
but if at any time I should be ill, Betty&mdash;if
anything serious were to happen to me&mdash;you and
Jack would be all alone."</p>

<p>Betty nestled closer to her mother's side, and
softly kissed the hot fingers.</p>

<p>"I sometimes fear, dear, that I have done
wrong in not making more friends," Mrs. Randall
said, after another fit of coughing. "People
would have been kind I dare say, but I have always
been so proud and reserved. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57">57</a></span>
families where I teach would have been friendly
if I had let them. I almost wish now that I
had."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hamilton is very kind," said Betty
eagerly; "and she came to see you."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, and I liked her too, but I have always
so dreaded being patronized. You know,
dear, that I haven't always been poor."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I know; you were not poor in
England."</p>

<p>"I have often told you about my English home,
and about your Uncle Jack, and how happy we
were together when we were children. I have
been thinking a great deal of those times
this evening, and all last night I dreamed of
Jack."</p>

<p>"He was your twin brother, wasn't he,
mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and we were everything to each other.
Our mother died when we were babies, and our
two sisters were much older, almost grown up in
fact, while we were still little children. I suppose
my father loved us in his way, but he was very
stern, and we were all rather afraid of him. Our
older sisters were very good to us little ones, but
they had their own affairs to think of, and so
Jack and I were left a good deal to ourselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58">58</a></span>
Such merry times as we had&mdash;such pranks as we
played."</p>

<p>"You mean the time when Uncle Jack rode
the wild colt, and the day you climbed the plum
tree, and fell and broke your arm," said Betty,
glad to have her mother's thoughts turn in this
direction, and hopeful of new stories.</p>

<p>"Yes, those and many others, but, Betty dear,
I want to talk to you about something else to-night.
You have never heard very much about
your father, have you, darling?"</p>

<p>"No, mother," said Betty softly; "I know
you don't like to talk about him."</p>

<p>"I ought to like it, but I loved him so dearly
that for a long time after his death I could not
bring myself to mention his name to any one, even
my own children."</p>

<p>"Did Uncle Jack love him too?" Betty asked
rather timidly; "you said you always liked the
same things."</p>

<p>"They never met. Jack was at college when
your father first came into our neighborhood. He
came to visit at the vicarage; Mr. Marvyn, our
vicar, had known his father. By that time both
my sisters were married, and as I was often lonely
at home when Jack was away, I got into the habit
of spending a good many days with the Marvyn<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59">59</a></span>
girls, who were about my own age. Your father
was only a poor artist, but he was very clever, and
people said he would make his mark in the world
some day. Jack was very fond of sketching himself,
and I think that was one reason why I first
began to be interested in your father. We used to
go off on sketching expeditions together that
spring, and we grew to know each other very
well. Jack was invited to spend his summer vacation
in Switzerland with a party of friends, and
he decided to go. It was the first vacation he had
not spent with me, and I think I was more hurt
and jealous than I had any right to be under the
circumstances. I wrote him how I felt, and he,
as was only natural, thought me silly, and told
me so. That made me angry, and we quarreled
for the first time in our lives. It was only
a foolish little quarrel, but it kept me from telling
him, as I should otherwise have done,
how much I was going about with Archie
Randall.</p>

<p>"At first my father did not seem to notice how
things were going, but I think some one must
have warned him, for one day when I came back
from a long walk with your father, he called me
into his study, and told me he did not wish me to
have anything more to do with young Randall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60">60</a></span>
who was only a penniless artist, and not a proper
companion for one of his daughters.</p>

<p>"I am not going to tell you about that time,
Betty. I was very angry, and I am afraid I did
not behave very well towards my father, who was
an old man, and who I think really loved me.
When he found that I would not obey him, he
sent for Archie, and forbade him to see me again.
Then all at once your father and I found out how
much we cared for each other. He was very honorable.
He wanted me to wait for him while he
went away and made a name for himself, but I
was young and headstrong, and I loved him better
than anything else in the world. The end of it
was that we ran away, and were married in London
by special license."</p>

<p>Betty gasped. This was the most interesting,
romantic story she had ever heard.</p>

<p>"And didn't your father ever forgive you?"
she questioned breathlessly.</p>

<p>"No, never. He wrote me one letter after my
marriage, and only one. He said that I had disgraced
my family, and he never wished to see my
face again. He said he had changed his will, and
that neither I nor my husband should ever inherit
a penny of his money."</p>

<p>"And Uncle Jack, was he angry too?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61">61</a></span></p>

<p>"He wrote me only once. He was very much
grieved, and could not understand how I could
have acted as I had done. That was twelve years
ago and I have never heard a word from him
since.</p>

<p>"We came to America, and after a time your
father obtained employment as an illustrator for a
publishing firm here in New York. Then you and
Jack were born. We were very happy in those
days, and if it had not been for my longing to see
Jack and know that he forgave me, I should have
been quite content. I was too proud to write to
him, but kept hoping that something would
happen to bring us together again, and that he
and my husband might become good friends.
Then, six years ago, just as we were beginning
to feel that we were really making our way in the
world, your father died."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall paused, and Betty felt the hand
she held quiver convulsively, but after a moment's
pause she went on again.</p>

<p>"It was a terrible struggle at first. I had never
been brought up to support myself, and now I was
left alone in the world with two little helpless
children to care for. Little Jack was frightfully
delicate. The doctors told me that it was only by
the very tenderest care that I could hope to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62">62</a></span>
him. Twice I decided to write to my brother
Jack. He would help me, I knew. I even wrote
the letters, but I tore them up again. I was too
proud. I could not ask for help even from
him.</p>

<p>"My music was my only talent, and in time
I succeeded in procuring pupils. It has been
hard work ever since, but I have managed
somehow, and you and Jack have never suffered."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, we haven't, mother; we've had
lots of good times, and Jack is ever so much
stronger than he used to be."</p>

<p>"I know that, and I am very thankful. If I
can only keep my health&mdash;I have always been
very strong. Why, I don't think I have ever been
really ill in my life."</p>

<p>A spasm of coughing interrupted Mrs. Randall's
words, and it was several minutes before she
was able to speak again.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I am telling you all this to-night,
Betty, unless it is that I feel so restless
and wakeful. If I keep well everything will be
all right, but if anything should ever happen&mdash;things
do happen sometimes you know, darling&mdash;if
you and Jack are ever left alone in the
world, then you must try to find your Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63">63</a></span>
Jack. He will be good to you and love you for
my sake, I know."</p>

<p>"Where does he live, mother?"</p>

<p>"I don't know where he is now, but a letter
sent to the old home would probably reach him.
My father has been dead for nearly two years&mdash;I
saw the notice of his death in an English newspaper&mdash;and
Jack, as his only son, would naturally
inherit everything. My father was a general,
you know&mdash;General Stanhope. In my desk you
will find a letter addressed to John Stanhope, Esq.,
Stonybrook Grange, Devonshire, England.
That is the address of my old home. You must
see that it is stamped and posted. I wrote it
shortly after my father's death. I thought that I
ought to make some provision in case of anything
happening to me. In it I have told him everything,
and asked him to care for you and Jack.
Why, my darling, what are you crying for? I
didn't say anything was going to happen. Hush,
I hear Jack stirring; I am afraid our talk is disturbing
him. Now turn over like a good little
girl, and go to sleep. I feel better than I did, and
I shall try to go to sleep too."</p>

<p>Betty, much reassured by her mother's words,
obeyed as far as turning over was concerned, and
soon the only sounds to be heard were the ticking<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64">64</a></span>
of the clock and Mrs. Randall's heavy breathing.
Betty lay awake for some time, thinking over the
story she had heard, but she was only a little girl,
after all, and before very long her thoughts grew
dim and confused; she fell into a doze, and in a
few moments more was fast asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>WINIFRED TO THE RESCUE</h3>

<p>When Betty next opened her eyes it was
broad daylight, and the morning sunshine
was peeping through the chinks
of the shutters. Her first thought was of her
mother, and she was glad to find that Mrs.
Randall was still asleep. She was breathing
heavily, but her eyes were closed, and she
did not cough. Even when Betty rose softly,
and crept round to the other side of the bed to
look at her more closely, she did not move, although
she was as a rule a very light sleeper.</p>

<p>"It's after seven," said Betty to herself, glancing
rather uneasily at the clock; "I don't think
mother ever slept so late before."</p>

<p>Just then she heard Jack stirring in his bed,
and she hurried into the next room to tell him to
be very quiet, as mother was still asleep.</p>

<p>"Is she better?" Jack inquired in an anxious
whisper, as Betty bent over him in motherly
fashion, to arrange his pillows more comfortably.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66">66</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I think so; her eyes are shut, and she's
lying very still. I only just woke up myself."</p>

<p>"I've been awake for ever so long," said Jack;
"I've been listening to mother. She doesn't
cough so much any more, but she breathes so
hard, and sometimes she moans. Oh, Betty, I'm
frightened; I don't know why, but I am." And
the poor little fellow buried his face in the pillow,
and began to cry.</p>

<p>Betty dropped on her knees by the bedside,
striving to comfort her little brother by every
means in her power.</p>

<p>"There isn't anything to be frightened about,
Jack, there really isn't," she whispered soothingly.
"Mother's all right; she told me she was better
last night before she went to sleep, and, oh, Jack
dear, she told me something else; such an interesting
story, all about father and our grandfather
and Uncle Jack. I'll tell you all of it by and by.
There's mother calling me; don't let her see you've
been crying."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall's eyes were open when Betty returned
to her bedside. Indeed, the little girl's
first impression was that they were unusually
bright. There was a bright color in her cheeks
too, but Mrs. Randall's first words quickly dispelled
Betty's hope that she was better.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67">67</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid I shall not be able to get up this
morning, Betty," she said, and her voice had
sunk to a hoarse whisper now; "I seem to have
lost all my strength, and there is such a terrible
pain in my chest that I can scarcely breathe."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, what shall we do?" cried Betty
in sudden consternation. "Oughtn't you to have
a doctor come to see you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall shook her head decidedly.</p>

<p>"No, no," she said impatiently, "I can't
afford to have a doctor; I will lie here for a while,
and perhaps I shall feel better. What day is it?"</p>

<p>"Thursday," said Betty, trying to control the
sudden trembling of her knees.</p>

<p>"That's too bad; Mrs. Flynn is always engaged
on Thursdays, I know. I thought she might be
able to come in and help. Well, you'll have to
manage about breakfast as well as you can. I
don't want anything myself, but you must prepare
some oatmeal, and boil some eggs for Jack and
yourself. Tell Jack he must stay in bed a little
while longer, but that just as soon as I can I will
come and dress him."</p>

<p>That was the strangest morning Betty and Jack
had ever spent. Never before in their remembrance
had their mother failed to be up and about
by seven o'clock. Even in those sad days, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68">68</a></span>
Betty could just remember, after their father's
death, her own grief had never prevented her
from fulfilling the little household duties. Now
she lay still, with closed eyes, scarcely noticing
what went on about her. Betty brought her some
tea, and she drank it thirstily, but refused to
touch any food. Once she roused herself sufficiently
to say that she thought a mustard plaster
on her chest might ease the pain, but when Betty
inquired anxiously how to make one, she did not
answer, and seemed to have forgotten all about
the matter.</p>

<p>Jack was very good and patient, but he was,
if anything, more frightened than Betty, and
his white, drawn little face was pitiful to see.
Betty made him as tidy as she could, gave him
his breakfast, and brought him his new story book
to read, but he shook his head mournfully.</p>

<p>"I don't want to read this morning," he said;
"I'd rather just lie still."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, you're not going to be ill too, are
you?" cried Betty, the tears starting to her eyes.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not ill, only I can't read; I wish I
could see how mother looks."</p>

<p>"She looks all right," said Betty encouragingly;
"she's got a lovely color in her cheeks,
only I wish she'd wake up and talk about things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69">69</a></span>
I don't know what to do about going to market,
and I suppose we ought to tell her pupils she
can't give them any lessons to-day."</p>

<p>"She's talking now, I hear her," said Jack in
a tone of relief. "Oh, Betty, she's calling me.
Yes, mother, dear, I'm all right; I'm so glad
you're better."</p>

<p>Betty flew to her mother's side.</p>

<p>"Are you better, mother?" she asked eagerly.
"I'm so glad you're awake, because I want to
ask&mdash;&mdash;" She paused abruptly, terrified by the
strange look in those bright, feverish eyes. Her
mother was looking straight into her face, but
did not seem to see her.</p>

<p>"Jack, Jack," she kept repeating in her low,
hoarse whisper, "Jack, I want you. I did wrong,
I know, but you will forgive me. You will be
good to the children, and love them for my sake,
won't you, Jack?"</p>

<p>Betty's face was very white, her eyes big with
terror.</p>

<p>"Jack," she gasped, running back to her
brother's room, and flinging herself down beside
him in an abandonment of grief and despair,
"mother's talking in her sleep; she doesn't know
what she's saying. She thinks Uncle Jack is
here. Oh, what shall we do&mdash;what shall we do?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70">70</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll have to get some one to come and see
her," said Jack with decision. "Run down and
ask Mrs. Hamilton to come; I know she will,
she's so kind."</p>

<p>Betty sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"I'll go right away," she said, "perhaps she'll
know what to do. Mother says she can't afford
to have a doctor. Oh, there's the door bell; I'm so
glad somebody's come."</p>

<p>She ran to the door, threw it open, and then
drew back a step in surprise. The visitor was
Winifred Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said Winifred pleasantly.
"Mother's gone out shopping with Aunt Estelle,
and she said I might come and see you and Jack.
I was coming before, but I've had a bad cold ever
since Saturday, and mother was afraid of the
draughts on the stairs. I haven't been to school
all the week. Why, what's the matter&mdash;is Jack
ill?"</p>

<p>"No," said Betty; "Jack's all right, but oh,
I'm so sorry your mother's gone out. I was just
going to ask her if she wouldn't please come up
here to see mother."</p>

<p>"Is there something the matter with your
mother?" Winifred inquired sympathetically.</p>

<p>"She had a bad cold yesterday, and this morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71">71</a></span>
she's worse. She keeps her eyes shut most
of the time, and doesn't understand the things I
say to her. I'm afraid she is very ill&mdash;oh, I'm
afraid she is." And Betty burst into tears.</p>

<p>Winifred's tender little heart was filled with
compassion.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, don't," she whispered, throwing
her arms impulsively around Betty's neck;
"maybe she'll be all right soon. I'll tell mother
about it the minute she comes in, and she'll come
right up. Do you think Jack would like to have
me stay with him for a while? I might read to
him while you're doing things for your mother."</p>

<p>Betty said she was sure Jack would like it very
much, and having dried her eyes on Winifred's
handkerchief, she led the way to her brother's
bedside.</p>

<p>"Jack," said Betty softly, "here's Winifred
Hamilton. Her mother's out, but she's going to
tell her about mother just as soon as she comes
home."</p>

<p>Jack looked pleased.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you," he said politely, holding
out his thin little hand. "I'm usually up on the
sofa by this time, but mother wasn't able to dress
me this morning."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Winifred, giving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72">72</a></span>
outstretched hand a hearty squeeze. "When
people aren't very strong they often stay in bed
quite late, you know. Your mother's awake now,
isn't she, Betty? I hear her talking."</p>

<p>Betty stole on tiptoe to her mother's door, but
returned in a moment.</p>

<p>"She's only talking in her sleep," she said
anxiously. "I spoke to her, but she didn't
answer. Did you ever see any one who was very
ill, Winifred?"</p>

<p>"I saw Mr. Bradford have an attack once,"
said Winifred; "his eyes were shut, and he
looked very white. Mrs. Bradford sent for the
doctor. Why don't you have a doctor come to
see your mother?"</p>

<p>"She doesn't want one," said Betty, coloring.
"I asked her this morning, and she said she
didn't. Would you mind coming to look at her,
Winifred? Perhaps you can tell what the matter
is."</p>

<p>Winifred said she would not mind, and, hand
in hand, the two little girls stole into the dark
little bedroom, and stood looking down at the
flushed face on the pillow. Mrs. Randall was
tossing restlessly from side to side, and talking
in a low, incoherent way.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Betty in a voice that she tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73">73</a></span>
hard to make steady and cheerful, "here's Winifred
Hamilton. She came up to see us, and she's
going to read to Jack."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall muttered something unintelligible,
and her eyes wandered past the two children,
and fixed themselves vacantly on the opposite
wall.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to be ill," she said, apparently
addressing some unseen person; "I can't be ill,
you know. I must take care of the children;
there's no one else to do it."</p>

<p>"She's delirious," whispered Winifred, looking
frightened. "I never saw any one like that
before, but I've read about it in books. I'm sure
a doctor ought to see her."</p>

<p>Betty's cheeks were scarlet, and her eyes
drooped, but she said nothing, and in silence they
went back to Jack. The little boy looked imploringly
at Winifred, as if with some faint hope
that she might be able to set matters right.</p>

<p>"Do you think she's very ill?" he asked tremulously.</p>

<p>"I think a doctor ought to see her," said Winifred
decidedly. "My friend Lulu Bell's papa
is a doctor, and he's very kind. Would you
like to have me ask him to come and see your
mother?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74">74</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Betty sharply; "mother doesn't
want a doctor; I told you so before."</p>

<p>"But, Betty," persisted Winifred, "she ought
to have some medicine or something, and we
don't know what to do for her. I know mother
would send for a doctor right away if she were at
home."</p>

<p>To Winifred's surprise, Betty suddenly put up
both hands before her face, and burst into a passion
of crying.</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall we do&mdash;what shall we do?"
she sobbed, rocking herself backward and forward
in her distress; "we can't have a doctor, mother
said we couldn't; she said we couldn't afford it."</p>

<p>For a moment Winifred stood motionless, uncertain
what to do or say. Jack hid his face in the
bedclothes, shaking from head to foot with sobs.
Next instant both Winifred's arms were around
Betty's neck.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do, Betty," she whispered
eagerly. "I'll go and see Dr. Bell myself,
and tell him all about it. He's very kind indeed.
Lulu says he often goes to see poor&mdash;I mean
people who can't afford to pay him, and when
Lulu's kitty got run over by a trolley-car and had
her leg broken, he set the leg himself, and took
such good care of the kitty that she got all well<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75">75</a></span>
again. I'll go right away; he's always at home
in the morning, and I know he won't mind coming
one single bit. Oh, Betty, please, please do
let me."</p>

<p>Betty wavered, but Jack, lifting his tear-stained
face from the pillow, cried imploringly:</p>

<p>"Yes, do go, Winifred, and, oh, please ask
him to come right away. Mother must have a
doctor, Betty, and it doesn't matter whether she
can afford it or not."</p>

<p>Winifred waited to hear no more. Three
minutes later she was ringing violently at her own
front door bell.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lizzie," she cried breathlessly, as the
maid opened the door, "I want you to put on
your hat right away, and come with me to
Dr. Bell's! Mrs. Randall is very, very ill, and
Betty and Jack don't know what to do for
her."</p>

<p>At first Lizzie seemed inclined to hesitate, but
when the state of the case had been more fully
explained to her, she willingly consented to leave
her ironing, and she and Winifred were soon in
the street hurrying towards the home of Winifred's
friends.</p>

<p>As they approached their destination, Winifred's
courage began to fail. After all, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76">76</a></span>
thought, she might be doing a very bold and unheard-of
thing in asking a doctor to go to see a
person who had frankly stated that she could not
afford to employ him. What if Dr. Bell were
angry&mdash;what if he refused to go? Winifred's
heart sank at the thought. Her friend Lulu
would be at school she knew, but possibly her
mother or aunt might be at home. Winifred decided
that in that case she would tell her story to
them. It would be much less formidable than appealing
directly to the doctor himself. Her heart
was beating very fast as they mounted Dr. Bell's
front steps and when the door was opened by a
small boy in brass buttons, who greeted her with a
broad smile of recognition, she could scarcely
summon voice enough to inquire:</p>

<p>"Are Mrs. Bell or Miss Warren at home,
Jimmie?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss, they've both of 'em gone out," returned
the boy, regarding her somewhat curiously.
"Miss Lulu's out too; she's gone to
school."</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew Lulu would be at school," said
Winifred, "but I thought Mrs. Bell or Miss
Warren might be in. I&mdash;I want to see the
doctor."</p>

<p>"Oh, the doctor's in all right. He's got a patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77">77</a></span>
just now, but you can wait in the front
office."</p>

<p>There was no help for it then, and, with a
little frightened gasp, Winifred followed the boy
to the doctor's comfortable office, where she sat
down on a sofa to wait until he should be disengaged.
She did not have long to wait. In a few
moments she heard the front door open and close.
Then the door of the waiting room opened and
the doctor came in.</p>

<p>He was a tall gentleman with a kind, pleasant
face, and at sight of Winifred he came quickly
forward, smiling and holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, little Miss Winnie," he said
pleasantly, "and what can I do for you to-day?
Nothing wrong at home, I hope."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir," said Winifred, half her fears
vanishing at the sound of the doctor's kind voice;
"father and mother are very well. I've had a
cold, but I'm all right again now. I come&mdash;that
is, I want&mdash;oh, Dr. Bell, will you please do me a
very great favor?"</p>

<p>"Do you a favor?" the doctor repeated, still
smiling, and sitting down beside her on the sofa.
"Yes indeed, I will&mdash;that is, if I can. What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's to go and see Mrs. Randall, who lives in
our apartment house," Winifred explained timidly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78">78</a></span>
"She's a very nice lady, but she hasn't any
money to pay a doctor with. She's very ill
indeed, but she told Betty&mdash;that's her little girl,
you know&mdash;not to send for a doctor, because she
couldn't afford it."</p>

<p>The doctor looked a little puzzled.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she wouldn't care to see me then,"
he said, "if she objected to having a doctor sent
for."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she would," said Winifred earnestly,
"at least she wouldn't know anything about it,
and Betty and Jack would be so very glad. Jack
is a cripple, he can't walk at all; and, oh, it's
dreadful to see him so unhappy. Mrs. Randall
is really very ill. She doesn't know Betty and
she keeps talking to herself the way people in
books do when they're delirious.</p>

<p>"I said I'd come and tell you about it, and I
was sure you'd come, because Lulu says you're so
very kind."</p>

<p>The doctor smiled, but he was beginning to look
really interested.</p>

<p>"Did your mother send you for me?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Winifred's eyes sank.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, sir," she faltered, "mother's out
shopping, and doesn't know anything about it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79">79</a></span>
Perhaps I oughtn't to have come, but I didn't
know what else to do, and I was so very sorry
for Betty and Jack."</p>

<p>Winifred's lip quivered, and two big tears
rolled slowly down her cheeks. The doctor
patted her shoulder kindly.</p>

<p>"You did quite right to come," he said, "and
I will go to see your friend to-day."</p>

<p>"Will you please go just as soon as you can?"
Winifred asked eagerly.</p>

<p>The doctor rose and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"It is half-past ten now," he said. "I have to
stay in my office till eleven, and then I have one
or two serious cases to see, but I will be at Mrs.
Randall's as early as I possibly can."</p>

<p>"Now run along home, and if your mother
makes any objections, tell her I said you did
quite right to come, and that I am very glad you
did."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, sir, thank you very much indeed,"
said Winifred gratefully, and the look
she gave the doctor said more than any words
could have done. With a sudden impulse, he
bent and kissed her.</p>

<p>"You dear little girl," he said. And then another
patient was announced, and Winifred hurried
away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>FRIENDS IN NEED</h3>

<p>By the time Dr. Bell arrived at the apartment
house Betty and Jack were no
longer alone with their mother. Mrs.
Hamilton had returned from her shopping
expedition, and as soon as she heard the
story from Winifred, had hastened upstairs to
see what could be done. One glance at the flushed
face and bright burning eyes, had been enough to
convince her that Winifred had not exaggerated
matters and that Mrs. Randall was indeed very
ill. As for Betty, at the first glimpse of Mrs.
Hamilton's kind, sweet face it had seemed to the
little girl as though a great load had been suddenly
lifted from her shoulders.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton did not waste much time in
words, but at once set about the task of making
everybody more comfortable. In an incredibly
short time Mrs. Randall's face and hands were
bathed, and her bed smoothed; Jack was dressed
in his wrapper, and carried to his usual place on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81">81</a></span>
the sitting-room sofa, and a substantial meal was
in preparation in the kitchen. When the doctor
came, Mrs. Hamilton sent Betty to stay with
Jack, and the two children sat silently, hand in
hand, listening for any sounds that might come
from their mother's room.</p>

<p>"Do you think the doctor will make her well
right away, Betty?" Jack whispered at last.</p>

<p>"I guess he will if he can. He's got a very
kind face, and he smiled at me when I opened the
door. Hark, they're coming out now."</p>

<p>Next moment Mrs. Hamilton and the doctor
came into the room together. They both looked
grave and anxious.</p>

<p>"She must have a nurse," Betty heard the
doctor say in a low voice. "I will send one as
soon as I can, and be in again myself this evening.
You will stay with her till the nurse arrives?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, certainly; and the children, what of
them?"</p>

<p>The doctor glanced for the first time towards
the sofa where the two children sat, Jack propped
up with pillows, and Betty close beside him, holding
his hand. He remembered what Winifred
had said about the little crippled boy, and his
face softened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82">82</a></span></p>

<p>"We must see about them by and by," he said,
"and in the meantime I think we can count on
their keeping quiet."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir," said Betty eagerly; "Jack is
always very quiet indeed, and I won't make any
noise."</p>

<p>"That's right. You are both going to be brave
little people, I know, and perhaps by and by you
may like to go and make a little visit to some of
your friends, just until your mother gets
stronger."</p>

<p>"We haven't any friends," said Betty; "we
don't know any one at all, except Mrs. Hamilton
and Winifred."</p>

<p>The doctor looked surprised, and a little
troubled.</p>

<p>"No friends?" he repeated; "no aunts or
cousins?"</p>

<p>Betty shook her head.</p>

<p>"We have an uncle in England," she said,
"but we've never seen him. We haven't any relations
in this country. Mother has her pupils,
but we don't know any of them."</p>

<p>The doctor said no more, and was turning to
leave the room, when Jack spoke for the first
time since his entrance.</p>

<p>"Please, sir," he said tremulously, "would<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83">83</a></span>
you mind telling us&mdash;is mother going to be well
again pretty soon?"</p>

<p>"Pretty soon I hope, my boy," said the doctor
kindly, and coming over to the sofa, he took the
thin little hand in his and looked long and earnestly
into Jack's troubled face. "I shall do all I
can to make her well soon, you may be sure of
that."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Jack gratefully. "I
think you are a very kind gentleman," he added
in his quaint, old-fashioned little way.</p>

<p>The doctor smiled, gave the small hand
a friendly shake and hurried away, followed by
Mrs. Hamilton.</p>

<p>That was about the longest afternoon Betty
and Jack had ever known. Mrs. Hamilton was
very kind, but she was too busy to pay much attention
to them, and they were left pretty much to
themselves. There was no use in trying to read
or to play games. They tried lotto, but it proved
a miserable failure. Then Betty tried reading
aloud, but a big lump kept rising in her throat
and choking her, and they soon gave that up as
well. After all, the most comforting thing
seemed to sit hand in hand, talking in whispers,
and listening to every sound from the sick-room.</p>

<p>At about four o'clock there was a ring at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84">84</a></span>
bell, and Betty, hurrying to admit the visitor, encountered
in the hall a tall young woman, with a
bright, sensible face, who carried a traveling bag,
and who Mrs. Hamilton told her was the nurse
Dr. Bell had promised to send. After that there
was a good deal of whispering and moving about,
but no one came near the children, and the time
seemed very long indeed.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when the doctor came again.
The children heard his voice in the hall, and after
a little while he and Mrs. Hamilton came into the
sitting room together, and Mrs. Hamilton lighted
the gas.</p>

<p>"You poor little things," she said cheerfully,
"what a long, lonely afternoon you have had.
They've been as quiet as little mice, doctor, and I
feel sure Betty is going to be a great help to Miss
Clark. As for Jack, he is going to be a good,
brave little boy, and let Winifred and me take
care of him till his mother gets well again."</p>

<p>She bent over the sofa as she spoke, and softly
kissed Jack's forehead. He looked up in her face
rather apprehensively, and his lip trembled.</p>

<p>"You're very kind indeed," he said politely,
"but if you please, I'd rather stay with mother.
I'll be very good."</p>

<p>"I know you will be good, dear; but, you see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85">85</a></span>
there isn't very much room here. Betty will have
to sleep in your bed, and then there is Miss Clark,
you know. So I want you to be a very good boy,
and come home with me. Betty shall come down
to see you the first thing in the morning, and you
and Winifred will have such good times together."</p>

<p>Jack began to cry.</p>

<p>"I'd rather not, indeed, I would much rather
not," he sobbed; "I've never been away from
mother and Betty at night. Mother always puts
me to bed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton looked distressed and rather
helpless, but the doctor came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"Jack," he said pleasantly, sitting down beside
the little boy, "what would you like to be when
you grow up?"</p>

<p>"An artist," said Jack promptly, and in his
surprise at the question he forgot to cry. "My
father was an artist, and I want to be one too.
My grandfather was a general, and I'd like to
be a soldier, but I couldn't, you know, on account
of not being able to walk."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," said the doctor,
smiling; "fighting isn't the only part of a soldier's
duty, you know. Wouldn't you like to
begin by being a brave little soldier boy now?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86">86</a></span></p>

<p>"How could I?" Jack inquired wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Well, one very important part of a soldier's
duty is to obey orders. Now we know that you
want to stay here with your mother and Betty,
but we feel that it will be much better for you
to go home with Mrs. Hamilton, who has very
kindly offered to take you with her. Betty can
be a great help to Miss Clark, the nurse, if she
stays here. You would like to do something to
help your mother get well, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I would," said Jack, with a
brightening face.</p>

<p>"Well, the very best thing you can possibly do
for her at this moment is to obey Mrs. Hamilton,
and let me carry you downstairs to her rooms."</p>

<p>Jack was silent for a moment; his face was
twitching, and he clasped and unclasped his hands
nervously. Then he looked up into the doctor's
face.</p>

<p>"All right," he said bravely, "I'll go, only&mdash;only,
may I kiss mother good-night first?"</p>

<p>"Your mother is asleep now, but you may look
at her if you like. She is more comfortable than
she was this morning. Shall I take you in to
have a peep at her?"</p>

<p>Jack nodded&mdash;he was finding it rather hard
work to speak just then&mdash;and the doctor lifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87">87</a></span>
him in his arms and carried him into the bedroom.</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall was lying with closed eyes, still
breathing heavily, but no longer talking in that
strange, incoherent way that had frightened
Betty so much in the morning. Miss Clark, in
her nurse's uniform, sat at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>"Good-night, mother," Jack whispered very
softly, and he kissed his hand to the motionless
figure on the bed. "I'll be a good boy. Good-night
and pleasant dreams."</p>

<p>The nurse rose, and, at a sign from Dr. Bell,
followed them out of the room.</p>

<p>"This is Miss Clark, Jack," the doctor said;
"she is taking splendid care of your mother."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Jack, trying to
smile. "Won't you please be a little kind to
Betty too? I think she'll miss me."</p>

<p>"That I will, dear," said the nurse heartily;
and then she turned away hurriedly with a suspicious
moisture in her eyes.</p>

<p>It cost Betty a great effort to see her little
brother carried away from her, and she clung to
him passionately for a moment, feeling half inclined
to protest against such a strange state of
affairs. But she was a sensible little woman, and
realizing the necessity in this case, she forced a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88">88</a></span>
smile, and the last words that Jack heard as the
doctor carried him downstairs were Betty's cheerful
assurances that she should take good care of
mother, and come to see him the very first thing
in the morning.</p>

<p>It was no easy task for Jack to keep back the
tears, but he did keep them back, though he had
to bite his lip and to wink very hard indeed in
order to do it. Dr. Bell did not fail to notice the
effort, and he found himself beginning to like this
small boy immensely.</p>

<p>Winifred was watching for them at the open
door, and she gave Jack such a rapturous greeting
that it would have been impossible not to feel
gratified by it. Almost before he realized what
had happened, Jack found himself settled on a
comfortable sofa, with Winifred hovering over
him, and Mrs. Hamilton and Lizzie bustling about
completing the arrangements for his comfort.</p>

<p>"And now I must say good-night, my little
soldier," Dr. Bell said, taking Jack's hand as he
spoke. "I shall come to see your mother again
in the morning, and I have an idea that you and I
are going to be great friends. By the way, how
long is it that you have been laid up like this?"</p>

<p>"Ever since I was a baby," said Jack. "My
nurse let me fall, and it hurt my back."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89">89</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor said nothing, but looked interested,
and when he followed Mrs. Hamilton out of the
room a few moments later he asked her how long
she had known the Randall family.</p>

<p>"I never spoke to them until last week," said
Mrs. Hamilton, and in a few words she told the
story of Winifred's Thank Offering. The doctor
looked considerably surprised.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me that they are almost
total strangers to you, and yet that you are willing
to take all this trouble for them?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton smiled.</p>

<p>"People learn to help each other where I have
lived," she said simply; "and besides, I am so
happy myself now that I think I feel a little as
Winifred does, and should like to make a Thank
Offering too."</p>

<p>"I wish there were more people in the world
like you and Winifred," said the doctor heartily.
"I am sure it would be a better place than it is
if there were."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An hour later Jack was lying in a soft bed in
the little room opening out of Winifred's. Mrs.
Hamilton had undressed him almost as tenderly
as his mother could have done; had heard him
say his prayers, and when at last she had bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90">90</a></span>
down to give him a good-night kiss, Jack's warm
little heart had overflowed, and he had suddenly
thrown his arms around her neck.</p>

<p>"I love you," he whispered softly; "oh, I do
love you very much."</p>

<p>But when Mrs. Hamilton had turned down the
gas and gone away, and Jack found himself alone
in this strange room, away from his mother and
Betty, he began to feel very lonely. There was
no one to see the tears now, and he let them have
their own way at last. He tried to cry very
softly, so as not to disturb Winifred in the next
room, but in spite of all his efforts the choking
sobs would come. Suddenly the door creaked
slightly, there was a patter of bare feet on the
carpet, and a sweet little voice whispered close
at his side:</p>

<p>"Are you asleep, Jack?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jack, speaking in a rather muffled
voice, for he had been trying to stifle his
sobs by burying his head in the pillow, "I
haven't gone to sleep yet, but I guess I shall
pretty soon."</p>

<p>"I just came to ask if you would like to have
one of the children for company. I know boys
don't care much about dolls generally, but they
are very comforting sometimes, especially when<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91">91</a></span>
people don't feel quite happy, and I thought you
might possibly like Lord Fauntleroy, because he's
a boy too, you know."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said Jack gratefully;
"I should like it. I never do play with dolls&mdash;boys
don't, you know, but a boy doll&mdash;well, that
seems a little different, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Of course it does," said Winifred confidently.
"Just wait a minute, and I'll bring him."</p>

<p>She darted away into her own room, returning
in a moment with Lord Fauntleroy in her
arms.</p>

<p>"I'll put him right here on the pillow beside
you," she said, "and if you should feel lonely,
you can just put out your hand and touch him.
There isn't anything to be lonely for really, you
know, because father and mother are in the parlor,
and I'm right here in the next room, but
people do sometimes feel a little queer in the dark,
especially if they're not used to it. Lulu Bell
doesn't like the dark a bit, and she was ten last
December. Now I guess we'd better not talk any
more, because mother said we were to go right to
sleep."</p>

<p>Whether it was the presence of Lord Fauntleroy
or the thought of the kind little girl who
had brought him I do not know, but, whatever the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92">92</a></span>
cause may have been, Jack did not cry any more
that night. He lay awake for a little while thinking
about how kind every one was, and then his
eyes closed, and he fell into a sound sleep from
which he did not wake till morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>A CHANCE FOR JACK</h3>

<p>For several days Mrs. Randall was very
ill, much worse than Jack ever knew, for
no one had the heart to tell him of the
anxiety that was filling their minds to the
exclusion of almost every other thought. Even
Betty had always a bright smile and a cheerful
assurance for her little brother that
mother would soon be better, no matter how
heavy her poor little heart might be. It was impossible
to help loving the sweet-tempered, gentle
little cripple, and Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton soon
found themselves growing very fond of their
guest, while Dr. Bell seldom failed to stop for a
word or two with his little soldier boy, as he
called him, after each of his visits to the invalid
upstairs. As for Winifred, she constituted herself
Jack's willing slave, and the two soon became
firm friends. They read together, played games
together, and finally, as a mark of especial favor,
Jack undertook to teach her to draw, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94">94</a></span>
honor which was highly appreciated by the little
girl.</p>

<p>Lulu Bell, hearing the story from her father,
came at once to see the interesting addition to the
Hamilton household, and the three children spent
a delightful afternoon together, the little girls
teaching Jack several new games, and being
taught several themselves in return. Betty, coming
in for a few moments to see how her brother
was getting on, found them all laughing heartily
over "My Grandmother's Cat." Jack's eyes
were fairly dancing, and there was a brighter
tinge of color in his cheeks than she had seen
there in many a day. Poor Betty's heart was
very heavy that day, and, somehow, the sight of
Jack's happiness&mdash;a happiness in which she had no
share&mdash;caused her to feel almost angry, although
she could not have told why. It was the first time
in his life that Jack had ever enjoyed anything
in which his sister had not an equal share.</p>

<p>Winifred greeted Betty very kindly, and Jack
begged her to stay and join in the fun, but the
little girl only shook her head sadly, saying she
must go back to her mother, as Miss Clark might
need her.</p>

<p>"But you'll come back very soon, won't you,
Betty?" Jack said a little wistfully, lifting his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95">95</a></span>
face for a kiss. "Oh, Betty dear, I am having
such a good time; I wish you could stay."</p>

<p><span><a name="image4" id="image4"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image4.jpg" width="400" height="634" alt="image4" title="image4" style="border: 1px solid" />
<span class="caption">Betty found them all laughing heartily over "My Grandmother's Cat."&mdash;<i>Page 94.</i></span>
</div>

<p>"I can't," said Betty shortly, and having
kissed her little brother she hurried away, winking
hard to keep back the tears.</p>

<p>On the stairs she encountered Miss Clark,
dressed for her daily walk.</p>

<p>"Your mother is asleep," the nurse explained,
"and Mrs. Hamilton is going to sit with her till
I come back. Don't look so worried, dear, she
isn't any worse to-day; indeed, we think she is a
little better."</p>

<p>Betty tried to smile, but the effort was rather
a failure, and when she had reached their
own apartment, sat down on Jack's sofa, laying
her head down on the cushion on which her little
brother's head had so often rested.</p>

<p>A few moments later, Mrs. Hamilton, going
into the kitchen for something she wanted, was
startled by the sound of low, subdued crying.
Glancing in at the door of the sitting room she
saw Betty lying face downwards on the sofa, her
whole frame shaking with sobs. Next instant she
was bending over the little figure, softly stroking
Betty's tumbled hair.</p>

<p>"Betty," she said tenderly, "poor little Betty,
what is it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96">96</a></span></p>

<p>With a start Betty lifted her face, and somewhat
to Mrs. Hamilton's surprise, grew suddenly
very red.</p>

<p>"It isn't anything," she said, beginning a hasty
search for her handkerchief, "only&mdash;only, I'm a
horrid, wicked girl."</p>

<p>"Betty, dear, what do you mean?" Mrs.
Hamilton sat down on the sofa and put an arm
affectionately around the trembling child. "Don't
you know what a great help you have been to
Miss Clark and me? Why, I have never seen a
more thoughtful, sensible little girl."</p>

<p>"I am wicked, though," Betty maintained
stoutly; "I'm jealous. I don't like to have Jack
so happy without me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton with some difficulty repressed
a smile.</p>

<p>"Jealousy is a very common fault in all of us,
Betty," she said, "but I am sure you wouldn't
like it if Jack were unhappy and fretting."</p>

<p>"No, oh, no, I shouldn't like that!&mdash;but"&mdash;with
a stifled sob&mdash;"he did seem to be having
such a good time, and I'm so unhappy and so
worried about mother."</p>

<p>"I know you are worried about your mother,
dear, but we all think her a little better to-day,
and Dr. Bell says that if she continues to improve<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97">97</a></span>
for the next twenty-four hours he hopes
she will be out of all danger. And now, Betty,
I am going to tell you something that I know you
will be glad to hear. It is about Jack."</p>

<p>"About Jack?" repeated Betty, beginning to
look interested.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. I know how dearly you love your
little brother, and how happy it would make you
if anything could be done for him&mdash;anything to
help his illness, I mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Hamilton, could anything really&mdash;&mdash;"
Betty could say no more, but her
flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes were more expressive
than words.</p>

<p>"Dr. Bell was talking to me about Jack last
evening," Mrs. Hamilton went on. "He is very
much interested in the case, and as soon as your
mother is well enough he is going to ask her consent
to bring a famous surgeon here to see Jack."</p>

<p>Betty was actually trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>"And he thinks&mdash;he thinks that something
might be done, so that Jack would be able to
walk like other people?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"He thinks something might be tried."</p>

<p>"I remember I once heard mother say that
when Jack was a baby a doctor told father that if
he ever grew strong enough to bear it an operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98">98</a></span>
might be performed. Jack was so delicate
for a long time that mother never dared to think
of it, but he is much stronger now."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Hamilton, rising, "we
won't talk to any one about it just yet, least of all
to Jack himself, because, you know, it might
amount to nothing, and then think how terribly
disappointed he would be. But you and I can
talk about it sometimes, and it will be our little
secret."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Betty eagerly, "and as soon as
mother is well enough she shall know too. Oh,
Mrs. Hamilton, you have made me so very, very
happy I don't know what to do."</p>

<p>There was no more jealousy for Betty that
day. She went about with a look of such radiant
happiness on her face that, when she came to kiss
Jack good-night, his first words were an eager
exclamation. "Oh, Betty, mother's better; I
know she is, or you wouldn't look like that!"</p>

<p>The next morning Mrs. Randall really was
better, and Dr. Bell came in after his early visit
to tell Jack the good news.</p>

<p>"You have been a good, brave little soldier,"
he said kindly, "and in a few more days you will
be able to go back to your mother and Betty."</p>

<p>"Betty has been much braver, though," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99">99</a></span>
Jack, always eager to sound his sister's praises.
"Mrs. Hamilton says she doesn't know what they
would have done without Betty."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, Betty has been a famous little
helper. I shall tell your mother she has two little
people to be proud of."</p>

<p>It was still some days, however, before Jack
could go home, or before Mrs. Randall was able
fully to understand the state of affairs. At first
she was too weak to care much about what went
on around her. She would lie with half-closed
eyes, only smiling faintly when spoken to, and
silently accepting all that was done for her without
appearing to think very much about it. But
as her strength began to return, cares and
anxieties returned too, and one morning, when
Mrs. Hamilton went up to relieve Miss Clark for
an hour, she found the invalid looking so flushed
and distressed that she hastened to inquire, as
she took the hand Mrs. Randall held out to her,
"Is anything wrong? Are you not feeling as
well this morning?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I am gaining strength every day,"
said Mrs. Randall with a sigh, "but, Mrs. Hamilton,
how can I ever repay you for all you have
done for us? I have been questioning Betty, and
she has told me everything."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100">100</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, my dear Mrs. Randall, please don't let
us talk about repaying anything," said Mrs. Hamilton
cheerfully. "You haven't the least idea of
the pleasure your dear little boy has given my
Winifred, and as for any little things that I may
have been able to do, why, they have given me
real pleasure too."</p>

<p>"You are very good, very good indeed," Mrs.
Randall murmured, "but I can't help worrying a
little when I think of all that this illness of mine
involves. There are so many expenses to think
of; the doctor and the nurse, and other things
besides. Miss Clark tells me that it will be several
weeks yet before I am able to go back to my
work, and it is so near the end of the season."</p>

<p>"I told Betty to write to your pupils, telling
them of your illness," said Mrs. Hamilton. "We
found a list of addresses in your desk. Several
notes have come for you, but I was afraid you
were not strong enough to see them before.
Would you like to read some of them now?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall said she would, and when she
had opened and glanced over the half-dozen notes
Mrs. Hamilton brought her, she looked up with
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"People are very good," she said a little unsteadily.
"I don't think I ever realized it before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101">101</a></span>
but I have a great deal for which to be thankful."</p>

<p>"I don't think we ever do realize what true
friendship means until trouble comes," said Mrs.
Hamilton gently. "I know I did not until a great
sorrow came to me. I now feel that there is no
greater happiness in the world than being able to
show my friends how much I care for them."</p>

<p>The two ladies had a long talk that morning,
and grew to know and like each other better than
either would have believed possible before. When
Mrs. Hamilton had gone back to her own apartment
Mrs. Randall called Betty to her side.</p>

<p>"Betty, darling," she said, and though there
were tears in her eyes, there was a more peaceful
expression on her face than the little girl had
ever seen there before. "I am afraid I have been
a very foolish, selfish mother to you and Jack,
but we all make mistakes sometimes, and I am
going to try and undo mine as soon as I can.
Everybody has been so good it makes me ashamed
of my old foolish pride. Mrs. Hamilton has
taught me a lesson this morning that I shall never
forget. I think she is the best woman I have
ever known."</p>

<p>That same afternoon Jack came home. Dr.
Bell carried him upstairs and laid him on the bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102">102</a></span>
beside his mother. How delightful it was to the
little cripple to nestle in his mother's arms once
more, and to feel her tender kisses on his face.
Neither of them said very much; but their happy
faces told the story plainly enough, and the doctor's
kind eyes glistened as he turned away rather
hurriedly to give some direction to Miss Clark.
But after the first few rapturous moments, Jack
found his tongue and chattered away, telling of
all the pleasant times he had had, and the kind
friends he had made, while Mrs. Randall listened;
and Betty hovered over them both with such a
radiant face that her mother asked her smilingly
if she had not something delightful to tell as well
as Jack. But Betty only blushed a little and
shook her head. She had no intention of disclosing
her secret just yet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Betty, it is nice to be at home again,"
said Jack, stretching himself comfortably on the
familiar sofa, when Miss Clark had carried him
away to the sitting room, leaving Mrs. Randall
to rest for a while. "I've had a perfectly lovely
time, but I do like home."</p>

<p>"You don't love Winifred better than me, do
you?" said Betty, with a little twinge of the
old jealousy.</p>

<p>"Why, Betty, how could I possibly do such<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103">103</a></span>
a thing as that?" Jack's eyes opened wide in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"I didn't know," said Betty, hanging her
head. "I'm awfully glad you don't."</p>

<p>"I love Winifred very much," said Jack
slowly, "but then you're my own sister, and of
course a person couldn't love another person as
much as his own sister. Oh, Betty, you didn't
really think I could, did you?"</p>

<p>Jack was beginning to look troubled, and
Betty, very much ashamed of herself, hastened to
reassure him.</p>

<p>"No, no, of course I didn't, not really, you
know," she said, giving her brother a hearty kiss.
"I was silly, that's all, but it's all right now.
Isn't it lovely having mother so much better?
Miss Clark says she can begin to sit up in a few
days, and such nice things have happened.
Nearly all mother's pupils have written kind
notes, and most of them have sent checks paying
up to the end of the term. I don't think mother
wanted to take the checks at first, but Mrs. Hamilton
talked to her, and she says she's going to
try not to mind so much about accepting favors
any more. I think there is only just one other
thing in the world that could make me happier
than I am to-day."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104">104</a></span></p>

<p>"What's that?" Jack inquired.</p>

<p>"To have you able to walk," said Betty softly.
She turned her head away as she spoke, so that
her brother should not see the expression in her
eyes.</p>

<p>Jack gave a little start, and drew a long, deep
breath.</p>

<p>"But, Betty," he said almost in a whisper,
"that's something that couldn't ever possibly
happen, you know. Oh, Betty, dear, please don't
talk about it, because you see it's impossible."</p>

<p>Suddenly Betty laid her face down beside her
brother's on the pillow, with a sob.</p>

<p>"Very, very wonderful things do happen sometimes,"
she whispered, "things that are almost as
wonderful as fairy stories. If you ever could
be made to walk, Jack, wouldn't you be the very
happiest boy in the whole world?"</p>

<p>"Of course I should," said Jack with decision,
"if it only could happen, but then you know,
it couldn't."</p>

<p>Betty said no more, but hugged Jack tight, and
kissed him a great many times, and then she went
away to the kitchen to help Miss Clark get dinner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE DOCTOR'S VERDICT</h3>

<p>Miss Clark's prediction proved correct,
and in a few days Mrs. Randall
was able to sit up, and to be helped
into the sunny little parlor, where she sat
by Jack's sofa, looking happier and more at
rest than the children had ever seen her look
before. After that she improved so rapidly that
even Dr. Bell was surprised, and declared he had
never seen a woman with a finer constitution.
At the end of another week Miss Clark went away
to another case, and Mrs. Flynn, the good-natured
Irishwoman who did the Randalls' washing,
was engaged to come in by the day. So the
bright spring days came and went, and when the
sun was brightest and the air warmest, Jack's
pale face would often look a little wistful, but
nothing more was said about drives in the park,
and Betty, still waiting patiently for leave to
reveal her secret, began to wonder if after all
Mrs. Hamilton had been mistaken, or Dr. Bell
had changed his mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106">106</a></span></p>

<p>One Saturday morning in May, Winifred appeared
shortly after breakfast, looking pleased and
excited, and bringing an invitation for Betty.</p>

<p>"It's from Lulu Bell," she explained, when
Betty, quite thrilled at the prospect, had brought
the visitor into the parlor to tell the news to her
mother and Jack. "Lulu asked Gertie Rossiter
and me to lunch with her and go to the circus
to-day, but Gertie has the measles, so Lulu telephoned,
and asked me to bring Betty instead.
Mother says she hopes you'll let Betty go, Mrs.
Randall, because she's sure Mrs. Bell would like
to have her very much."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall looked pleased.</p>

<p>"I am sure Betty would enjoy it," she said;
"you would like to go, wouldn't you, dear?"</p>

<p>Betty hesitated, and glanced a little uneasily at
Jack.</p>

<p>"I should like it," she said. "I've never
been to the circus and it must be lovely, but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Betty, you must go!" cried Jack eagerly.
"It'll be so nice, and you can tell me all about it
when you come home."</p>

<p>The time had been, and not so long before either,
when Mrs. Randall would have been inclined to
regard this invitation as an attempt at patronage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107">107</a></span>
but she had been learning more than one lesson in
these days of her convalescence, and Mrs. Hamilton's
kindly advice was beginning to bear fruit.</p>

<p>"Lulu says her mother doesn't want us to wear
anything especially nice," Winifred went on,
"because we shall go around to see the animals
before the circus begins, and it may be dusty.
I've got a lovely new book out of the library; it's
called 'Dorothy Dainty,' and I'm going to bring
it up for Jack to read this afternoon. I know
he'll like it."</p>

<p>Matters being thus happily arranged, Winifred
hurried away to telephone her friend that Betty
would be delighted to accept the invitation, and
Betty made herself very useful, helping Mrs.
Flynn with the Saturday cleaning, feeling all the
time as if she were about to enter upon a new and
very interesting experience.</p>

<p>"You're sure you don't mind, Jack," she said,
stooping to kiss him at the last moment before
going downstairs to join Winifred.</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said Jack heartily. "I hope
you'll have a lovely time, and it'll be such fun to
hear all about it."</p>

<p>"You're not a single mite jealous, are you?"
said Betty, with a sudden recollection of her own
feelings on another occasion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108">108</a></span></p>

<p>"No, of course not. What does it feel like to
be jealous?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know, I never went away and left
you for a whole afternoon, just to have fun
before, and I'm going to have a good time, and
you're not. You wouldn't like it if you were
jealous."</p>

<p>"But I am going to have a nice time," said
Jack, looking rather puzzled; "I've got that nice
book Winifred brought, and mother's going to
play for me. I wonder what being jealous really
does feel like."</p>

<p>"It doesn't feel nice," said Betty, blushing,
"but I don't believe you'll ever know anything
about it, you're too dear."</p>

<p>It was about twelve o'clock when the two little
girls, accompanied by Mrs. Hamilton, left the
apartment house, and started on their walk across
the park, to the Bells' home on Madison Avenue.
It was a beautiful day, and the park was full of
children, all making the most of their Saturday
holiday. They met several May parties, and
Betty told them how her mother had once read
them Tennyson's "May Queen," and how Jack
had been so much interested in the poem that he
had learned it by heart.</p>

<p>"Jack is really a very clever boy," said Winifred<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109">109</a></span>
admiringly. "I don't like boys very much
generally, they're so rough, but I respect Jack
very much indeed."</p>

<p>"There isn't any other boy in the world like
him," said Betty, with conviction. "Mrs.
Hamilton," she added rather shyly, "do you suppose
Dr. Bell has forgotten Jack, now that he
doesn't come to see mother any more?"</p>

<p>"I am very sure he has not," said Mrs. Hamilton
decidedly.</p>

<p>Betty said no more on the subject, but her heart
beat high with renewed hope, and during the
rest of the walk she felt as if she were treading
upon air.</p>

<p>Betty could not help feeling a little uncomfortable
when she first caught sight of the handsome
house where Winifred's friends lived. She
had met Lulu only once, and although she looked
upon the doctor as one of her best friends, she
did not know any other members of the family,
and the thought of being presented to entire
strangers was a rather embarrassing one. Mrs.
Hamilton, having another engagement, left them
at the foot of the steps. Winifred rang the bell,
and when the door was opened by the boy in brass
buttons, she walked in with the air of a person
very much at home. Betty followed more slowly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110">110</a></span>
wondering rather uncomfortably what people
who lived in such a grand-looking house would
think of her faded brown dress and last year's
straw hat. But all such speculations were
speedily forgotten in the kind cordiality of the
greeting she received. Lulu was a charming
little hostess, and her mother and her blind aunt
both greeted the little stranger so kindly, that they
soon succeeded in making her feel almost as much
at home as Winifred herself.</p>

<p>At luncheon the ladies asked questions about
Jack, and quite won Betty's heart by telling her
of the many kind things the doctor had said about
her little brother. Lulu had a great deal to say
about the pretty seaside cottage her father had
just hired for the summer.</p>

<p>"You must come and make us a long visit,
Winifred," she said decidedly, but Winifred
shook her head.</p>

<p>"I can't leave mother," she said, with equal
decision on her part. "It's so perfectly beautiful
to have her, I can't ever go away from her."</p>

<p>"There is a good hotel very near us," said Mrs.
Bell kindly. "Perhaps your father and mother
will come there to board for a while."</p>

<p>But Winifred still looked doubtful. She had
an idea that money was not very plentiful with <span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111">111</a></span>
her family just then, and she had heard her
mother say that a couple of weeks in the mountains,
while father had his vacation, would
probably be all they could afford that summer.</p>

<span class="caption">What a delightful afternoon that was!&mdash;<i>Page 111.</i></span>
</div>

<p>As soon as they rose from the luncheon table
Mrs. Bell and the three little girls started for the
circus.</p>

<p>What a delightful afternoon that was! Even
Betty's wildest anticipations had scarcely prepared
her for the blissful reality. She enjoyed every
moment, and every incident, from the clown who
made her laugh till she cried, to the "Battle of
Santiago," which made her shiver and cling
tightly to Winifred's hand.</p>

<p>"It's been the loveliest afternoon I ever knew,"
she said gratefully to Mrs. Bell, when it was all
over, and the little girls were saying good-bye at
the door of the apartment house. "It was so
kind of you to take me, and I shall have lots and
lots to tell Jack."</p>

<p>"I am very glad you could come with us, dear,"
said Mrs. Bell, smiling kindly, "and next year I
hope we can take Jack with us too."</p>

<p>"I suppose it isn't a very nice thing to say,"
Lulu whispered to Winifred, "but I can't help
being a little glad Gertie has the measles. I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112">112</a></span>
like Betty ever so much, and I know mamma likes
her too."</p>

<p>At the door of the Hamiltons' apartment the
children separated, and Betty ran gayly upstairs,
thinking of the delightful time she should have
living the events of the afternoon all over again
in describing them to Jack. She opened the front
door with her key, and was just going to call out
to her mother and Jack, when something in the
unusual stillness of the place caused her to pause
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps mother's lying down," she said to
herself, "and Jack doesn't like to make any noise
for fear of disturbing her. I'll go in softly and
see."</p>

<p>She stole on tiptoe to the sitting room door, and
peeped in. Her mother was not there, but Jack
was lying on the sofa as usual. At sight of her
the little fellow started up and held out his arms.
One glance at his face was enough to convince
Betty that something had happened.</p>

<p>"What is it, Jack?" she whispered, running to
his side, and beginning to tremble with a strange
new sensation, but whether of joy or fear she did
not know. "What makes you look so&mdash;so queer?
Where's mother?"</p>

<p>"Mother's in her room," said Jack; "she shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113">113</a></span>
the door; she's gone to lie down, I guess." His
voice trembled, and he hid his face on Betty's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"But something has happened, I know it has,"
persisted Betty, trembling more than ever. "Oh,
Jack, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Betty," said Jack softly, "do you remember
what you said the other day, about&mdash;about the
thing that would make you happier than anything
else, even than mother's getting well?"</p>

<p>"You mean the thing about you&mdash;oh, Jack,
you mean about your being made to walk?"</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>"Tell me quick," gasped Betty breathlessly,
the circus and everything else forgotten in the
excitement of this wonderful news.</p>

<p>"Well, Doctor Bell came this afternoon right
after lunch, and there was another doctor with
him. He was rather old, and not so nice as Dr.
Bell, but I think he wanted to be very kind. First
they went in the dining room, and talked to
mother for a little while, and I think I heard
mother crying. Then they came in here, and
looked at me. What they did hurt a good deal,
but I tried not to mind, because Dr. Bell called
me a brave soldier boy. Then they went back to
the dining room, and talked some more to mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114">114</a></span>
and the new doctor went away. After that
mother and Dr. Bell came back here. Mother
was crying a good deal, but she looked awfully
glad too, and they told me what it all meant.
Next week I'm to go to a hospital, and have an
operation. It won't hurt, Dr. Bell says, because
they'll give me something to make me go to sleep,
and when I get better, they think&mdash;they're not
quite sure&mdash;but they really do think, that I shall
be able to walk."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>SUSPENSE</h3>

<p>It was very quiet in the Randalls' apartment
one warm spring afternoon. For nearly two
hours the only sounds to break the utter stillness
had been the ticking of the clock and an occasional
movement from the kitchen, where Mrs.
Flynn tiptoed softly about, preparing dinner.
Mrs. Randall sat in the armchair by the open
window. Her face was white and set, and sometimes
her lips moved, but no sound came from
them. Betty felt sure that her mother was saying
her prayers. It seemed to Betty as though a
month must have passed since the morning. She
had tried to read, to sew, to do anything to pass
the terrible hours of suspense, but it was of no
use, and now she sat on a stool at her mother's
feet resting her head against Mrs. Randall's knee.
She was trying very hard to be brave, but she
knew that if she dared glance even for a moment
at Jack's empty sofa, she would no longer be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116">116</a></span>
to choke down the rising sobs, or keep back the
tears which seemed so near the surface.</p>

<p>Early that morning Jack had been taken away
to the hospital, and even as they sat there in
silence, Betty and her mother knew the work was
being done which was to decide the fate of the
little boy for life.</p>

<p>The doctors had decided that it would be best
to perform the operation before hot weather set
in, and besides, as Dr. Bell wisely explained to
Mrs. Randall, it would never do to keep the
child in suspense any longer than necessary, now
that he knew what was impending. Mrs. Randall
was not yet strong enough to leave the house,
but Dr. Bell had come himself for Jack, and Mrs.
Hamilton had gone with them to the hospital,
promising to remain until the operation was over.
Jack had been very brave and cheerful, and the
excitement had helped every one up to the last
moment. Dr. Bell had told funny stories to make
them all laugh, and Mrs. Hamilton had talked
about the nice things they would bring Jack when
they came to the hospital to see him. No one
had cried, only, just as the last good-byes were
being said, Jack had suddenly thrown his arms
round his mother's neck and clung to her, and
Mrs. Randall had clasped him close to her heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117">117</a></span>
and held him there in a silence that was far more
expressive than any words. And now it was
afternoon, and Betty and her mother were
waiting, in silent, breathless suspense, for the
news that they both knew must come before
long. Mrs. Hamilton had promised to
let them know the moment the operation was
over.</p>

<p>The door creaked softly and Mrs. Flynn came
in with a cup of tea in her hand.</p>

<p>"Take a drop of tea, dearie, do," she whispered
soothingly, bending over Mrs. Randall's
chair; "it'll put heart into ye."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall shook her head impatiently.</p>

<p>"Not now, Mrs. Flynn; I couldn't touch anything
now, it would choke me. Perhaps by and
by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Flynn turned away with a sigh, and went
back to the kitchen, beckoning to Betty to follow
her.</p>

<p>"Can't you do nothin' to cheer her up a bit,
darlin'," she whispered, when Betty joined her
in the kitchen. "Not a mouthful of anything has
she touched this whole blessed day, and it's awful
to see her sittin' lookin' like that, her that's just
off a sick bed too."</p>

<p>"She's thinking about Jack," said Betty<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118">118</a></span>
sadly; "she can't eat till she knows; I couldn't
eat either, Mrs. Flynn."</p>

<p>Mrs. Flynn sighed again, and set down the
teacup.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll hear pretty soon now, I guess,"
she said, with an air of resignation, "and I've
got some nice strong chicken soup on the stove.
A cup of that'll do yez both good by and by."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Flynn," whispered Betty, drawing
close to the kind-hearted Irish-woman, "I'm so
frightened. I don't know why, but I am. You
don't think, do you, that anything dreadful is
going to happen?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, darlin'," said Mrs. Flynn
reassuringly. "Jack'll be all right, the little
angel, and we'll have him back, and runnin' about
like any one else in just no time at all. Why, I
shouldn't wonder if we'd see him ridin' one of
them bicycles on Fifth Avenue next month."</p>

<p>"But people don't always get over operations,
you know, Mrs. Flynn," said Betty, with a choke
in her voice.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," retorted Mrs. Flynn, with an indignant
toss of her head. "Sure, didn't me
brother-in-law's first cousin have the two legs
of him took off wid a trolley-car on Lexington
Avenue, and ain't he walkin' around now 'most as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119">119</a></span>
good as ever on two cork stumps, as they give him
at the hospital? There ain't nothin' them doctors
can't do, barrin' raisin' the dead."</p>

<p>A ring at the door bell at this moment put an
end to the Irish-woman's hopeful predictions.
Betty uttered a little half-frightened cry, and
Mrs. Flynn flew to open the door. Mrs. Randall
sprang from her chair, and was in the hall before
Mrs. Flynn had left the kitchen. Next moment,
however, there was a little sigh of disappointment
from every one; the visitor was only
Winifred.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd come to see you for a little
while," she explained to Betty, who was trying
to smile, and not show the disappointment she
felt. "It's lonely downstairs without mother, and
I've done all my lessons. I've brought Miss
Mollie; I thought you might like to have her."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to have her," said Betty, taking
the doll in her arms. She was not very fond
of dolls, but she wanted to show Winifred that
she appreciated her kindness. "Let's go into my
room, where we can talk and not disturb
mother."</p>

<p>They were moving away, but Mrs. Randall
called them back.</p>

<p>"Stay here, children," she said, and her voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120">120</a></span>
sounded sharp from anxiety. "I like to hear you
talk, and you don't disturb me."</p>

<p>So the two little girls went into the parlor, and
sat down side by side on Jack's sofa, Betty still
holding Miss Mollie in her arms. They were both
very silent at first, and Winifred kept casting
sympathetic glances towards Mrs. Randall, who
had now left her seat, and was standing with her
back to them, looking out of the window. But
after a little while they began to talk in whispers.</p>

<p>"I guess mother will be back pretty soon now,"
said Winifred, giving Betty's cold little hand an
encouraging squeeze. "She'll be sure to come
and tell you about Jack the very first thing."</p>

<p>Betty said nothing, and after a little pause
Winifred went on.</p>

<p>"Won't it be lovely when Jack gets well? Just
think, he may be a soldier after all when he grows
up. You know Dr. Bell always calls him a little
soldier boy."</p>

<p>"He'd like to be one," said Betty, brightening
at the thought; "our grandfather was a general,
you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, and even if he never goes to war, I think
he is much braver now than a great many real
soldiers are. Father says there are not many
little boys only nine years old who would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121">121</a></span>
willing to go away and stay all by themselves in a
big, strange hospital."</p>

<p>"Don't let's talk about that," said Betty, beginning
to cry. "I can't bear to think of his
being all by himself."</p>

<p>"Oh, but he won't be, not really. Lulu has been
to that hospital to see the children and take them
things, and she says the nurses are very kind.
One of them took care of Lulu's aunt when she
broke her knee last year, and they all liked her
very much. And then, you know, Dr. Bell goes
there every day, and we shall go too, just as soon
as Jack is well enough to see us. Oh, Betty,
dear, I'm sure God is going to let Jack get well
and be just like other people. I've been saying
little prayers to Him all day about it."</p>

<p>"So have I," said Betty, who was beginning to
find Winifred's society very cheering. "He'll
be so happy if he can walk, and mother says Dr.
Bell wants us all to go to the country as soon as
Jack is strong enough."</p>

<p>Winifred heaved a little sigh.</p>

<p>"I think almost every one is going to the
country pretty soon," she said. "School closes
the end of next week, and all the girls are going
away the first part of June. I shall miss them all,
especially Lulu."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122">122</a></span></p>

<p>"Dr. Bell said they were going to the seashore
the first of June."</p>

<p>"Yes, they're going to Navesink; Lulu says
it's a lovely place. There's the ocean, you know,
and a river, where they can fish and catch crabs.
I've never seen the ocean; Aunt Estelle doesn't
like sea air, so we always went to the mountains."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to go to Navesink too?"
Betty asked.</p>

<p>"I should just love it. Lulu wants me to come
and visit her, but of course I can't leave mother."</p>

<p>"New York isn't so bad in summer," said
Betty cheerfully. "We were here last year. It's
nice in the park and on the Riverside, but of
course the real country must be much nicer."</p>

<p>"I think any place is nice where mother is,"
said Winifred, with simple conviction. "Oh,
Betty, there's the door bell, and it's mother's
ring."</p>

<p>Betty sprang to her feet, and darted out into
the hall. Mrs. Randall took a few quick steps towards
the door, but then her strength failed her,
and, with a low cry, she sank on her knees on the
floor beside Jack's sofa, trembling from head to
foot, and covering her face with her hands.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton came straight into the room.
She passed the two little girls without a word, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123">123</a></span>
there was a look on her sweet face that somehow
kept them both silent, eager as they were for news.
For one second she paused beside the sofa, and
then dropping on her own knees, took the trembling,
swaying figure right into her kind arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, my dear," she sobbed, the happy
tears streaming down her cheeks, "I don't know
how to tell you, but it is all as we wished. The
operation is over; it was a great success, the doctors
say, and&mdash;and&mdash;don't tremble so, dear&mdash;there
is nothing to grieve over, but, oh, so much to
make you glad. I have just come from the hospital,
and Dr. Bell has sent you this message.
'Tell Mrs. Randall,' he said, and there were
tears in his eyes, 'tell Mrs. Randall that everything
is going on splendidly,' and&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
think of it, my dear,&mdash;'that her little boy will
walk.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>A LETTER AND A SURPRISE</h3>


<p>"Here's a letter for you, Winnie," said
Mr. Hamilton, coming into the dining
room, just as his wife and little daughter
were sitting down to breakfast one warm
morning in the beginning of July.</p>

<p>"It's from Lulu," exclaimed Winifred joyfully,
glancing at the handwriting. "Oh, I'm
so glad! I haven't had a letter from her since
she went away."</p>

<p>"This is a good fat one, at any rate," said Mr.
Hamilton, smiling, and Mrs. Hamilton added:</p>

<p>"Read it to us, dear."</p>

<p>So Winifred opened her letter and began:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: right">"<span class="smcap">Navesink, N.J.</span>, July 6th.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Winifred:</span></p>

<p>"I meant to write to you ever so long ago, but
I have been so busy that I couldn't find the time.
This is a lovely place, and we all like it very
much. The ocean is right in front of the house,
and in the big storm last week the waves came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125">125</a></span>up all over the lawn. We go in bathing every
day that the ocean is smooth enough, all but Aunt
Daisy. She is afraid of the big waves, but
papa says she wouldn't be if she would only make
up her mind to go in once. On the other side of
the house is the Shrewsbury River, and that is
very nice too. All the Rossiters came up to spend
the day last Saturday, and papa took us crabbing.
I caught three, and we had them for luncheon.
There is an old boat fastened to our dock. It
hasn't any oars, or rudder, or anything, but it's
splendid to play shipwreck in.</p>

<p>"I see the Randalls almost every day. The
house where they are boarding is only a little
way from our cottage. Jack looks ever so much
better than when he came, and papa says the
sea air is making him stronger every day. He
can stand all by himself now, and walk a little
with his crutches. Papa thinks by the autumn
he will be able to walk as well as anybody.
Mamma has given him a go-cart, and Betty and I
push him about in it. We all go down to the
beach, and when we have made a nice seat in the
sand for Jack, he gets out of the go-cart and sits
there. I like Betty and Jack ever so much, and
mamma likes to have me play with them.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Randall has a good many pupils already,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126">126</a></span>and mamma thinks she will have more by and by,
when all the summer people get here. Aunt
Daisy is taking music lessons from her, and says
she is the best teacher she ever had. She plays
beautifully too. Mamma had her come over and
play for some people the other day, and they all
enjoyed it very much.</p>

<p>"I am having a lovely time, but I do miss you
very much. Can't you really come and make me
a visit? Mamma and Aunt Daisy would love to
have you, and there are two beds in my room. I
should be so very, very happy if you would only
come.</p>

<p>"My hand is getting tired, so I shall have to
stop.</p>

<p>"Betty and Jack send their love, and say they
would love it if you would come. Please answer
this letter right away, and believe me, with lots
of love and kisses,</p>


<p style="margin-left: 15em">"Your true friend,<br />
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 2em">"Louise M. Bell."</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"That's a lovely letter," said Winifred in a
tone of profound admiration. "Lulu writes
beautifully, don't you think so, mother?"</p>

<p>"She certainly expresses herself very well,"
said Mrs. Hamilton, smiling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127">127</a></span></p>

<p>"She writes stories too," Winifred went on,
putting her letter carefully back into the envelope;
"she intends to be an authoress when she
grows up. She did think once that she would be
a missionary, but now she has decided that she
would rather be an authoress like her aunt."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to go to Navesink and
make Lulu a visit?" Mr. Hamilton asked.</p>

<p>Winifred looked a little wistful, but she shook
her head decidedly.</p>

<p>"Not without mother. If mother could go
too, I should love it better than anything else in
the world."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton exchanged glances,
but they were both silent, and nothing more was
said on the subject.</p>

<p>As soon as they rose from the breakfast table,
Winifred went to put her letter away in the little
box where she kept all her treasures, but before
doing so she sat down on the edge of her bed, and
read it all over again from beginning to end.
When she had finished, her face looked even
more wistful than before.</p>

<p>"I should like to go, oh, I should like it very
much," she said, with a long sigh, "but I couldn't
go anywhere without mother. I suppose when
people have only had mothers a little while like<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128">128</a></span>
me, they feel differently about leaving them from
the people who have had them all the time."</p>

<p>The fact was, Winifred was feeling a little bit
lonely. It was very warm in the city, and now
that school was over, and all her friends had left
town, she found time hang somewhat heavy on
her hands. The children were a great comfort,
of course, and her mother was everything to her,
but she missed the work and the companionship
of school, and there were times on those hot
summer days when even story books seemed to
have lost their charms.</p>

<p>She and Betty had become great friends during
the time when Jack was in the hospital, and when
Dr. Bell had decided that the seashore was the
place for Jack, and the Randalls had given up
their flat, and gone for the summer to board at
Navesink&mdash;the kind doctor having procured accommodation
for them in a house not far from
his own&mdash;Winifred, although rejoicing heartily
in her friends' good fortune, could not help feeling
very forlorn without them. It was two
weeks now since the Randalls had gone away,
and Lulu's letter was the first news Winifred had
received from any of her friends.</p>

<p>On this particular morning things were unusually
dull. It was very hot, for one thing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129">129</a></span>
then her mother and Lizzie were both very busy
in the kitchen, putting up strawberry preserves.
Lulu's letter had suggested so many pleasant possibilities
too. Certainly sea bathing and playing
shipwreck in a real boat sounded much more attractive
than reading story books in a hot little
bedroom on the second floor of a New York
apartment house. She did her duty faithfully
by the children; dressed them all; set Lord Fauntleroy,
Rose-Florence, and Lily-Bell at their lessons,
arranged Miss Mollie's hair in the latest
fashion, and gave Violet-May a dose of castor
oil. Then when there was really nothing more
to be done for her family, and she had learned
from her mother that her services were not desired
in the kitchen, she took up "Denise and Ned
Toodles," and settling herself in the coolest spot
she could find, tried to forget other things in the
interest of a new story.</p>

<p>"Well, mousie, here you are; deep in a story
book as usual."</p>

<p>At the sound of the familiar voice, Winifred
dropped her book, and sprang up with an exclamation
of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Estelle, I am glad to see you!" she
cried joyfully, running to greet the tall, bright-faced
young lady who was standing in the doorway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130">130</a></span>
"How did you get in? I never heard the
bell."</p>

<p>"I didn't ring, the door was open," said her
aunt, laughing and kissing her. "I've been here
for some time, talking to your mother in the
kitchen, and now I've come to have a little talk
with you."</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" said Winifred, hospitably
drawing forward the comfortable rocker
in which she had been sitting. "You look
awfully warm. You sit here, and I'll fan you;
that'll be nice."</p>

<p>"What have you been reading?" Mrs. Meredith
asked, as her little niece perched herself on
the arm of her chair, and began swaying a large
palm-leaf fan back and forth.</p>

<p>"'Denise and Ned Toodles.' It's a very nice
story. Mother got it out of the library for me
yesterday. It's all about a little girl who lived
in the country and had a pony."</p>

<p>"Do you think you would like to live in the
country?" her aunt asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so; I should like it in the summer,
at any rate. Oh, Aunt Estelle, I had such a
lovely letter from Lulu this morning. Would you
like to see it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very much, but not just now, for I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131">131</a></span>
in a hurry. I am going downtown to do some
errands, and then I am coming back here, and,
Winnie, I want you to be ready to go home with
me to spend the night."</p>

<p>"To spend the night?" Winifred repeated,
looking very much surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes; Uncle Will was grumbling this morning,
because he says he never sees anything of
you nowadays. We are going to the country on
Saturday, you know, and this will be our last
chance of having you with us for ever so
long."</p>

<p>"I'd like to go if mother says so," said Winifred,
rather pleased at the prospect of this little
change.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right; everything is arranged,
and here comes your mother to speak for herself."</p>

<p>Winifred turned eagerly to Mrs. Hamilton,
who had just entered the room.</p>

<p>"Mother, Aunt Estelle wants me to go home
with her to spend the night. May I go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said her mother, smiling, "I
should like to have you go. I expect to be very
busy this afternoon, and Aunt Estelle says Uncle
Will wants to see you very much."</p>

<p>"Norah is cleaning silver to-day," Mrs. Meredith<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132">132</a></span>
said, as she rose to go. "You should have
seen her face when I told her I was coming for
you."</p>

<p>Winifred looked flattered.</p>

<p>"I always helped Norah clean silver," she said,
"and sometimes I used to read to her. I'll take
'Denise and Ned Toodles' and read this afternoon."</p>

<p>The matter having been thus arranged, Mrs.
Meredith hurried away to do her errands, promising
to return for Winifred in a couple of
hours.</p>

<p>"You're sure you won't miss me very much,
mother," Winifred said anxiously, as she was
bidding her mother good-bye. "It's only for one
night, you know, and that is quite different from
going away for a real visit."</p>

<p>"Of course it is," said Mrs. Hamilton, laughing.
"Now run along with Aunt Estelle, sweetheart,
and have a good time. I will come for you
early to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Mother does seem very busy to-day," remarked
Winifred, rather wonderingly, as she
walked along by her aunt's side. "I wonder
what she's going to do this afternoon. It
can't be the preserves, because they're 'most
done."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133">133</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Meredith made no answer, and Winifred
soon forgot her curiosity in the interest of other
subjects. But she would have wondered a good
deal more if she could have heard the words her
mother was at that moment saying to Lizzie, for
no sooner had the door closed behind Winifred
and her aunt than Mrs. Hamilton hurried back to
the kitchen.</p>

<p>"We can begin right away now, Lizzie," she
said, laughing; "the darling is safely out of the
way for the rest of the day, and we shall have
to work like beavers to accomplish all we have to
do. In the first place, I want you to come with
me to the storeroom, and help me to get out that
big trunk."</p>

<p>Winifred had a very pleasant afternoon. She
helped Norah with the silver, and read aloud to
her, and then there were Hannah, the German
cook, and Josephine, the French maid, to be talked
to, and they both seemed much pleased to see her.
In the evening Uncle Will and Aunt Estelle made
much of her, and when bedtime came, although
she missed her mother's good-night kiss, still it
seemed so natural to be going to bed in the old
familiar nursery, where she had spent so many
nights, that she could almost fancy the past
happy months were all a dream, and that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134">134</a></span>
mother had never come back from California at
all.</p>

<p>"Only no dream could possibly be so lovely as
it really is," she said to herself, settling herself
comfortably on her pillow when Aunt Estelle had
put out the light and gone away. "Oh, I am
glad it isn't a dream, but something really true.
I was a wicked girl to wish I could go to the
country and do something different, when I've
got such lots and lots of things to be happy
about."</p>

<p>"This is the very perfection of a summer's
day," Mr. Meredith remarked at the breakfast
table next morning. "I wish I were not obliged
to spend it cooped up in my office. A trip to the
seaside now would be very much to my liking."</p>

<p>"We're going to take excursions sometimes
this summer," said Winifred brightly. "Father
says perhaps we may go down to Manhattan
Beach for a Sunday. Did you ever go to Manhattan
Beach, Uncle Will?"</p>

<p>"Yes, several times. I have been to Navesink
too. Isn't that where your friends, the Bells, are
spending the summer?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Lulu says it's a beautiful place. She
asked me to come for a visit, but I can't leave
mother."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135">135</a></span></p>

<p>"Too bad, isn't it?" observed Mr. Meredith,
with his eyes on his plate. "Halloo, there's the
door bell; I wonder who can be coming to see us
so early in the morning."</p>

<p>"Why, it's father and mother," exclaimed
Winifred joyfully, springing down from her
chair, and darting out into the hall as Norah
opened the front door. "Oh, mother, dear, you
are early. We've only just finished breakfast."</p>

<p>"It is such a lovely morning," said Mrs. Hamilton,
returning her little daughter's rapturous
embrace, "that your father and I thought we
would take a trip down the bay."</p>

<p>"Oh, how nice," cried Winifred, clapping her
hands. "And isn't it funny? Uncle Will and I
have just been talking about trips. Are you sure
you can really get away for a whole day, father?"</p>

<p>"I think I can manage it," said Mr. Hamilton,
laughing. "Now run and get ready, little one,
for our boat leaves at ten, and it's after nine already."</p>

<p>Winifred flew upstairs for her belongings, told
the good news to Josephine, and was back again
in less than five minutes. She found her father
and mother in the dining room with Uncle Will
and Aunt Estelle. They had evidently been talking
about something which amused them, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136">136</a></span>
every one was smiling, but as soon as Winifred
came in Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton rose to go.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Winnie darling," said Mrs. Meredith,
kissing her little niece affectionately, "it
has been like a bit of old times having you back
with us. You won't forget to write, Mollie?"
she added in a lower tone to Mrs. Hamilton, as
the two ladies went out into the hall together.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, mousie, and don't forget us," said
Uncle Will, as Winifred lifted her face for his
good-bye kiss. "I don't know how we shall
manage to get on without you all summer."</p>

<p>"Why, mother," said Winifred, looking puzzled,
as they hurried away towards the elevated
railroad station, "Uncle Will and Aunt Estelle
said good-bye just as if they weren't going to see
us again, and they're not going to the country till
Saturday."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they were afraid something might
prevent our meeting again before they leave," said
Mrs. Hamilton, rather evasively.</p>

<p>That sail down the bay was a new and very delightful
experience to Winifred. She had never
traveled much, and every new object of interest
was a delight to her. The big, crowded steamboat,
the beautiful bay, the Statue of Liberty, and
the other interesting sights made the little girl feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137">137</a></span>
as if she could not take in so many new wonders
all at once, and she asked innumerable questions
about everything, all of which her father and
mother answered readily.</p>

<span class="caption"> That sail down the bay was a new and delightful
experience.&mdash;<i>Page 136.</i></span>
</div>

<p>"What are we going to do when we get to the
place where the boat stops?" she inquired anxiously,
as they passed the Floating Hospital.
"Must we go right back to New York again?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think we will go a little way in a
train first," said Mr. Hamilton, trying to look
grave, although his eyes twinkled. "It would
be rather a pity to go so far without seeing the
ocean, don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, are we really going to see the ocean?"
cried Winifred joyfully. "I think this is one of
the nicest things that ever happened."</p>

<p>At the Atlantic Highlands they left the boat,
and got into a train, which they found waiting at
the pier. There were several trains, in fact, and a
great many people seemed to be getting into them.
Winifred wondered where they were all going,
and if any of the other children she saw were having
half as good a time as she was.</p>

<p>"Look, Winnie, there is the ocean," her
mother said eagerly, as the train rushed across a
long bridge, and a whiff of sea air blew in their
faces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138">138</a></span></p>

<p>"Where, where?" gasped Winifred, stretching
her neck out of the car window. "Oh, I see.
Why, how big it is. I never saw water like that
before. Do you suppose it looks like this at
Navesink?"</p>

<p>"I should not be at all surprised if it looked
very much like it," said Mrs. Hamilton, laughing.</p>

<p>At that moment the train began to slacken
speed.</p>

<p>"Navesink, Navesink," shouted the brakeman,
putting his head in at the car door.</p>

<p>"Isn't it the very loveliest surprise you ever
had?" demanded Lulu Bell, dancing up and
down on the platform, and hugging Winifred
tight. "I never knew a single thing about it till
last night, but mamma has known for ever so
long, and papa engaged the rooms at the hotel for
you. Why, Winifred, don't look as if you were
just waking up. It's the nicest thing in the
world. You're all going to stay at the hotel for
a month, and your father's going to town every
day the same as papa does. They wanted it to be
a surprise for you. See, here's Betty, and Jack's
right over there in the go-cart. We all came
down to the station to meet you, and it seemed
as if the train would never come, we were so
excited."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139">139</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," gasped Winifred, finding her voice at
last, "it's the very most beautiful thing that could
possibly have happened. Are you quite sure it's
all true, and not a dream?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140">140</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>AT NAVESINK</h3>

<p>"I think the sea is the most beautiful
thing in the world," said Jack, laying
down his drawing pencil, and settling
himself comfortably in the warm sand. "I could
just sit and look at it all day long."</p>

<p>"Is your sketch finished?" inquired Winifred,
looking up from the sand fort she was building.</p>

<p>"Yes, do you want to see it?" And Jack held
out a sheet of foolscap for his friend's inspection.
Jack was a very different-looking boy from the
pale little cripple of two months before. There
was a light in his eyes and a color in his cheeks
that no one had ever seen there since the day of
his babyhood. The healthy outdoor life in the
bracing sea air was doing wonders for him.
Winifred examined the sketch admiringly.</p>

<p>"It's perfectly lovely," she announced. "That
fishing boat with the man in it looks as natural
as can be. I think you will be a splendid artist
when you grow up, Jack."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141">141</a></span></p>

<p>Jack flushed with pleasure at this frank praise.</p>

<p>"I hope I shall," he said, "I want to be. You
know my father was an artist."</p>

<p>"You will be an artist and Lulu will be an authoress,"
said Winifred reflectively. "I wish
Betty and I could both be something nice too."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I shall never be anything in particular,
unless it's a housekeeper," remarked Betty
from her seat on the bathing house steps. "I
like to sweep and dust and cook better than anything
else."</p>

<p>"You'll be a greater sewer, I think," said Winifred,
with an admiring glance at the stocking
her friend was darning. "Mother says she never
saw a little girl who could sew as well as you
can."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall be a trained nurse. I think I
should like being a comfort to sick people. I
heard Lulu's aunt say the nurse she had when she
broke her knee was a great comfort to her."</p>

<p>"Miss Clark was a great comfort to us when
mother was ill," said Betty; "mother had a letter
from her yesterday. What's the matter, Jack&mdash;are
mosquitoes biting?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jack, frowning, "it isn't the
mosquitoes, it's only I don't like to have you talk
about being things when you grow up."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142">142</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?" inquired Betty in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Because if I'm an artist I can take care of you
and mother. I want you just to be ladies."</p>

<p>"Well, mother's a lady, isn't she? and she
works; and Lulu's aunt writes books."</p>

<p>Jack looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"I don't know quite how to say it," he said
slowly, "but I want you to be the kind of ladies
that mother was when she lived in England; the
kind that live in castles, and have parks and
things. They never work, do they?"</p>

<p>Both little girls laughed, and Betty said practically:</p>

<p>"I guess even queens work sometimes, but I
know what you mean, Jack, only I think I'd like
to be a housekeeper better."</p>

<p>"Here comes Lulu," exclaimed Winifred, rising
to meet her friend, who came hurrying along
the sand from the direction of her own home.
"I've brought some ginger-snaps," announced
Lulu, when she had greeted the others, and seated
herself beside Betty on the bathing house steps.
"I thought we might be hungry before luncheon
time. I could have come before, but I was very
busy writing my story. Is yours done yet, Winifred?"</p>

<p>"No," said Winifred, blushing; "I don't think<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143">143</a></span>
I can write stories very well. When I get the ink
and paper, and everything ready, I never can
think of anything to say."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must go on trying," urged Lulu.
"It's the easiest thing in the world when you
once get started. Does Betty know about what
we're doing?"</p>

<p>"No," said Betty, looking interested, "tell me
about it."</p>

<p>"Why, you see," Lulu explained, "Aunt Daisy
is writing a book, and in it two little girls have to
write compositions, and she thought it would be
so nice to have original ones written by real little
girls. So she asked Winifred and me to write
some for her, and if she likes them well enough,
she will put them in her book, and they will be
published. Won't that be fun?"</p>

<p>Betty and Jack were both much impressed, and
Winifred, who did not find authorship come at all
easy, was struck with a bright idea.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose your aunt cares who writes
the stories, so long as she gets them, does she,
Lulu?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, I don't suppose so," Lulu admitted,
"but you really must try, Winnie. Think how
grand it will be to have something published."</p>

<p>"I was only thinking that perhaps Betty or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144">144</a></span>
Jack could do it better," said Winifred, with an
appealing glance at her two little friends, both of
whom, however, declined to enter the compact,
declaring that they couldn't write a story to save
their lives.</p>

<p>"I can't see why you all find it so hard," said
Lulu a little patronizingly; "it seems very easy
to me. I was only five when I made up my first
story, and Aunt Daisy wrote it down on her typewriter.
It wasn't very long, only 'Two little
girls went to see two little boys. They played
hide and seek and blindman's buff. Then they
had ice cream, and went home again.' Aunt
Daisy said it was a beginning, and I've been writing
stories ever since. Oh, by the way, Aunt
Daisy says if you'll come over this afternoon she'll
tell us all stories on the piazza."</p>

<p>The children looked pleased, and accepted the
invitation with alacrity, for Lulu's blind aunt was
a famous story-teller and a great favorite with
them all.</p>

<p>"Papa and mamma have gone to the city for
the day," said Lulu, "and Aunt Daisy's very busy
this morning, writing on her story, but she's
promised to devote the whole afternoon to us."</p>

<p>The conversation drifted to other things, and
the next hour passed very pleasantly in building<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145">145</a></span>
sand forts, making mud pies, and doing other
delightful things only possible at the sea shore.
The ocean was very calm, and the little girls took
off their shoes and stockings, and let the little
waves splash over their feet. Jack lay on the
sand, watching them and making sketches by
turns. Some of the people from the hotels and
cottages came down to the beach to bathe, and
almost every one had a pleasant word for the
little boy.</p>

<p>At last the ginger-snaps were produced, and
they all sat down to enjoy them before going
home.</p>

<p>"I wonder what makes people so dreadfully
hungry at the sea shore," remarked Jack, helping
himself to his third ginger-snap. "At home I
never used to eat very much."</p>

<p>"It's because you're so much better than you
used to be," said Betty, regarding her brother
with happy, loving eyes. "What's the matter,
Lulu? you've dropped your cake."</p>

<p>"My goodness," exclaimed Lulu, clasping her
hands in dismay. "I declare I forgot all about
telling you the most important thing. A lord is
coming to stay with us."</p>

<p>"A what?" inquired Betty and Winifred both
together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146">146</a></span></p>

<p>"A lord," repeated Lulu impressively, "a real
live English lord. He's coming on his yacht.
Papa got a letter from him yesterday, and he's on
his way now."</p>

<p>"Where is he coming from?" Winifred asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but he's traveling in his yacht.
He has a castle in England, and he's awfully rich.
Mamma thinks he will bring a valet with him."</p>

<p>"How did your family happen to know him?"
inquired Betty, much interested.</p>

<p>"He and papa went to college together in
England. He wasn't a lord then, though; he only
got to be one about a year ago, papa says, because
his uncle and his cousin, who were lords, both
died, and he inherited the title."</p>

<p>"Just like Little Lord Fauntleroy," said Winifred;
"I wonder if he minded it the way Fauntleroy
did at first."</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Lulu, with superior wisdom.
"Fauntleroy was only a silly little boy. I
guess every man would like to be a lord if he had
the chance. He and papa were great friends at
college, and papa says he used to be very jolly
and full of fun. I think he must really be rather
nice, for when I asked papa whether I should say
'my lord' or 'your lordship' when I spoke to
him, he only laughed, and said he didn't believe it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147">147</a></span>
would make much difference. I always thought a
lord would be very angry if people didn't say
'my lord' or 'your lordship' whenever they
spoke to him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's because he's such a new one that
he isn't so very particular," Winifred suggested.
"What made him come over to this country?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I suppose because he wants to
see it. He cruises about in his yacht, and mamma
doesn't think he will stay very long with us,
though she hopes he will on account of papa's
being so fond of him. I hope he won't make a
very long visit, for I suppose it can't help being
rather solemn having a lord in the house."</p>

<p>"Lords in books are just like other people,"
Betty remarked practically. "Perhaps you'll like
him ever so much, and be sorry when he goes
away."</p>

<p>"I hope I shall see him," observed Jack, with
unusual animation.</p>

<p>"What for?" inquired Betty, with some scorn.
"I don't believe he looks a bit different from any
one else."</p>

<p>"Well, we're English, you know," Jack explained,
"and I should like to see a real English
nobleman. It would be the next best thing to seeing
the queen."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148">148</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think I should be so very anxious to
see the queen," declared democratic Betty. "I
don't believe she's any different looking from
other old ladies."</p>

<p>"Mother says we're subjects of the queen,"
Jack maintained, "and ought to love her, and you
know if you have to love a person you would naturally
like to see her. I don't know whether we
have to love lords or not, but I should like to
see one any way."</p>

<p>"There's mother on the bluff," said Winifred.
"She's beckoning to us; I guess it must be time
to go in."</p>

<p>The children scrambled hastily to their feet,
Jack was helped into the go-cart, and the little
party started in a homeward direction.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, dear, we've had a lovely time this
morning," exclaimed Winifred enthusiastically,
as they joined Mrs. Hamilton on the bluff, "and
Lulu has asked us all over to her house this afternoon.
Her aunt is going to tell us stories."</p>

<p>"That will be very nice," said Mrs. Hamilton,
smiling. "One of the ladies at the hotel has
asked me to drive with her this afternoon, and I
was rather doubtful about leaving you at home
alone, but if Miss Warren wants you it will be all
right."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149">149</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma has gone to New York," Lulu explained,
"but Aunt Daisy wants them all. I
must run home now, for it's nearly one. Be sure
you all come by half-past three. I have to do my
lessons right after lunch, but I shall be all through
by then."</p>

<p>"Jack and I have to do some lessons too," said
Betty, "but we'll be at your house by half-past
three. We'll stop for you, Winifred, as we pass
the hotel."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall was standing on the piazza of
the boarding-house as Betty and Jack approached,
and her tired face brightened wonderfully at
sight of the two children. Betty was pushing
the go-cart, and Jack waved his hand joyfully
to his mother. Both little faces were
radiant.</p>

<p>"Aren't you back earlier than usual, mother?"
Betty asked, as they went into the house together,
Jack moving slowly and cautiously on his
crutches, but walking as neither his mother or
Betty had ever expected to see him walk.</p>

<p>"Yes, rather earlier. Miss Leroy was going
to a luncheon, and didn't take her full time.
I shall be busy all the afternoon until six
o'clock, though, for I begin with two new pupils
to-day."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150">150</a></span></p>

<p>"Lulu Bell has asked us over to her house,"
said Betty; "her aunt is going to tell us stories.
You don't mind our going, do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed, only don't tire poor Miss
Warren out telling you stories, and if you get
home before six, you may take Jack down on the
beach for a little while. Dr. Bell wants him to
be in the open air as much as possible."</p>

<p>"Mother," said Jack suddenly, as his mother
was making him comfortable in the big wicker
armchair by the window of their pleasant room
on the ground floor, "did you ever see a lord when
you were in England?"</p>

<p>"I think I have seen several in my life," said
Mrs. Randall, smiling; "why do you want to
know?"</p>

<p>"Because one is coming to stay at Lulu Bell's
house, and I want to see him very much."</p>

<p>"Lords don't look any different from other
people, do they, mother?" questioned Betty.</p>

<p>"Not in the least. I have an uncle who is a
lord."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall spoke rather absently, as though
she were thinking of something else, but the astonished
exclamations from both children quickly
recalled her thoughts.</p>

<p>"You haven't really, have you, mother?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151">151</a></span>
gasped Jack. Betty's eyes grew big and round
with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, my father's older brother was a lord, or
is one if he is still alive. We never knew him
very well, for his place was in a different county,
and he and your grandfather were not good
friends. I don't want you to mention this to any
one, though," she added, flushing; "it would
sound like bragging, and you know it is never
right to do that."</p>

<p>"I always knew we had ancestors," said Betty
thoughtfully, "but I never supposed any of them
were lords. Is that the reason why you hate to
accept things from people, mother?"</p>

<p>"I scarcely think that has much to do with
it," Mrs. Randall said, laughing in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"Is your lord uncle in England now, mother?"
Jack asked.</p>

<p>"I suppose so if he is still alive. He must be
a very old man now, for he was several years
older than your grandfather."</p>

<p>"And if he is dead, who is the lord now?"</p>

<p>"The title would naturally descend to his only
son, my cousin. I never saw him, but I remember
hearing that he was a rather promising boy.
There is the bell for luncheon. Remember, children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152">152</a></span>
you are not to mention this subject to any
one, not even to Winifred or Lulu. I shall be
displeased with you if you do."</p>

<p>Both children promised readily, but all through
luncheon they were unusually silent, and when
they had gone back to their room, and Mrs. Randall
had started out on her afternoon rounds,
Jack remarked suddenly, as he was turning over
the pages in his English history:</p>

<p>"Now, Betty, you know the kind of lady I
want you to be. I don't believe lords' relations
ever work; not the lady relations, I mean, of
course the men do."</p>

<p>"I don't see any use in being related to people
if we don't even know them," said Betty, a little
discontentedly. "Anyhow, I don't want to think
about it, because if I do I shall forget and tell
people, and then mother will be displeased. I
don't care anything about lords, but if we could
find Uncle Jack, that's what I should like."</p>

<p>"Don't you think mother might write to him
some time?" Jack inquired wistfully.</p>

<p>"I know she won't, not unless she should be
ill again, and I don't want that to happen. Now
let's hurry and do our lessons, or we sha'n't be
through in time to go to Lulu's house with Winifred."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>DRIFTING</h3>

<p>Lulu was standing on the piazza, as the
three other children approached the Bells'
cottage, Winifred pushing the go-cart this
time, and Betty holding a parasol over Jack's head.
Instead of calling out a cheerful greeting as usual,
however, she ran hastily and silently down the
steps, and met them halfway across the lawn.</p>

<p>"We mustn't make any more noise than we
can help," she said softly. "Poor Aunt Daisy
has a dreadful headache. It came on all of a
sudden, and she's gone to lie down. She says it
may go away by and by if she can get a nap. Her
room is right over the piazza, so we mustn't disturb
her."</p>

<p>The children all expressed their sympathy and
regret.</p>

<p>"Shall we go down on the beach and play?"
Betty suggested.</p>

<p>Lulu looked doubtful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154">154</a></span></p>

<p>"It's pretty hot down there," she objected,
"and besides, we were there all the morning.
We might go for a drive, only Thomas is so
fussy, he never will harness the horses unless
somebody grown up tells him to. Jane's ironing,
so she can't take us anywhere. I'll tell you what
we might do though"&mdash;with a sudden inspiration&mdash;"we
might go down to the river and play
shipwreck. That old boat that's fastened to the
dock is just great to play shipwreck in. It's quite
easy to get into it, even Jack could manage it all
right, and I'd bring one of the cushions off the
piazza to make him comfortable."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it's quite safe?" inquired cautious
Betty, looking doubtful.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it's all right. We were in it the
day the Rossiters were here, and papa saw us.
It's fastened to the dock by a chain. Nothing
could possibly happen. Come along; it's lovely
and cool down there by the river, and if we stay
here we shall be sure to forget and talk loud, and
that will disturb Aunt Daisy."</p>

<p>"Oughtn't we ask some one first?" Winifred
suggested.</p>

<p>"There isn't any one to ask. Papa and mamma
are in New York, and Aunt Daisy's asleep. Jane
wouldn't know, and she always makes a fuss<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155">155</a></span>
about things she doesn't understand. If it hadn't
been all right, papa would have said so when the
Rossiters were here."</p>

<p>This seemed a practical argument, and although
Betty still felt a little uncomfortable about the
wisdom of the proceeding, she made no further
objections, and five minutes later the little party
were standing on the dock. It was, as Lulu had
said, very easy to step into the old rowboat,
which, indeed, looked safe enough even to Betty,
being fastened to the dock by a long chain. With
a little help from the girls, Jack succeeded in
crawling over the side, and was made comfortable
in the stern, while the others settled themselves
on the benches.</p>

<p>"Isn't it perfectly lovely here?" cried the little
boy enthusiastically, dabbling his hands in the
cool water. "I was never in a boat like this
before."</p>

<p>"Of course it's lovely," said Lulu in a tone of
unqualified satisfaction; "I told you it would be.
It's much nicer than on that hot piazza, or on the
beach either."</p>

<p>"There are mosquitoes," Winifred remarked,
flapping vigorously about her head with her handkerchief.
"Mosquitoes always do bite me most
dreadfully."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156">156</a></span></p>

<p>"That's because you're so sweet," said Lulu.
"Try not to think about them, and then you won't
mind. Aunt Daisy says if only people wouldn't
think about disagreeable things, they would be a
great deal happier."</p>

<p>"Look, look; I can make the boat rock," cried
the excited Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it fun?"</p>

<p>"Now," said Lulu, as usual taking the initiative;
"we are a party of shipwrecked people, escaping
in a lifeboat from a sinking ship. We are
away out in the middle of the ocean. All the
other people in the ship have been drowned, and
we have escaped in the only boat there was. I am
a widow lady traveling with my little boy. You
are my little boy, Jack, and you are very ill. You
must put your head in my lap, and keep your
eyes shut as if you were suffering a great deal.
Winifred is our faithful maid, who has been
everywhere with us, and has divided her last ship
biscuit with us."</p>

<p>"And what am I?" inquired Betty, beginning
to enter the spirit of the new game. "Don't
make the boat rock quite so hard, Jack, dear,
please."</p>

<p>"You are the kind old sailor, who has saved
us all. Some bad men on the ship wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157">157</a></span>
take this lifeboat, and leave us to drown, but you
shot them all down, and now you are taking us
to an inhabited island you know about. We have
been three days without food, and without seeing
a sail, but I have promised that if you will bring
us safely to land I will make you very rich."</p>

<p>"Are you very rich yourself?" inquired Betty.</p>

<p>"Of course, I'm a very great lady. No, I
think I will be a princess; that will be nicer, and
when people do brave things I make them my
knights."</p>

<p>"But there aren't any knights now," Winifred
objected.</p>

<p>"Well, then, it isn't now; it's a long time ago,
about the time of Queen Elizabeth, I guess. Now
come on, let's begin."</p>

<p>The next half-hour was one of the most delightfully
exciting periods the children had ever
enjoyed. Lulu's vivid imagination carried them
all along with it, and even practical Betty forgot
everything else in the interest of the shipwreck.
Jack played the suffering child to perfection;
moaned pitiously, and implored his mother in
feeble whispers for a crust of bread or a drop of
water. The food was all gone, Lulu said, but
Winifred endeavored to procure the desired water
by dipping her hands in the river, and splashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158">158</a></span>
salt water over Jack's face. Some of it ran
into his eyes, which was not pleasant, but Jack
was too polite to complain. Betty spoke words of
encouragement and cheer, while she scanned the
horizon through an imaginary telescope. Lulu
hung over her suffering child, soothing his woes
by the tenderest caresses and promising innumerable
purses filled with gold to Betty and Winifred,
as rewards for their faithful services, if ever
they should reach the shore alive.</p>

<p>"There's a dreadful storm coming up," announced
Lulu, suddenly glancing up at the cloudless
blue sky, and beginning to wave her arms
frantically. "We shall be drowned, I know we
shall. Make the boat rock as much as you can,
Betty, so it will seem as if the sea was getting
rough. Oh, what will become of us? Do you
think we shall all perish, sailor?"</p>

<p>"Can't say; hope not," said Betty, who had
an idea that all sailors spoke in short, jerky sentences.</p>

<p>"You'll save us if you possibly can, won't
you?" said Winifred, who was playing so hard
that she was almost frightened.</p>

<p>"Will if I can," returned Betty in the deepest
growl she could assume.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lulu, please let us see a sail pretty soon,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159">159</a></span>
urged Jack. "I'm getting so tired of keeping
my eyes shut, and it seems so dreadfully real."</p>

<p><span><a name="image7" id="image7"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image7.jpg" width="400" height="632" alt="image7" title="image7" style="border: 1px solid" />
<span class="caption">"There aren't any oars, and we're drifting."&mdash;<i>Page 159</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>"Oh, yes, we shall see one before long," said
Lulu reassuringly. "It'll come just at the last
awful moment; it always does in books."</p>

<p>At that moment a sudden burst of sunshine
dazzled all their eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, how funny," exclaimed Betty, forgetting
her nautical manner, and speaking in her
natural voice; "I wonder what makes it sunny
all at once. It was nice and shady a minute
ago."</p>

<p>A shrill scream from Winifred brought Betty's
wonder to an abrupt end.</p>

<p>"Look, oh look!" shrieked the little girl, pointing
with a shaking finger towards the shore;
"the boat's moving, it's moving all by itself."</p>

<p>Every one followed the direction of Winifred's
terrified gaze. Sure enough; several feet of
water already separated the boat from the shore.</p>

<p>"The chain's broken," gasped Betty, growing
very white. "It must have broken when we
made the boat rock so hard. There aren't any
oars, and we're drifting. Oh, what shall we
do?"</p>

<p>Winifred began to cry.</p>

<p>"It's all your fault, Lulu," she wailed; "you<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160">160</a></span>
said it was safe, and now we shall be drowned,
and what will mother do. Oh, oh, oh!"</p>

<p>Lulu was shaking from head to foot, but realizing
the truth of her friend's accusation, she
made an effort to think of some way of escape.</p>

<p>"Couldn't we jump out and wade ashore?"
she suggested desperately.</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Betty, with prompt decision;
"we don't know how deep the water is,
and besides we couldn't leave Jack."</p>

<p>Poor little Jack lifted his white face from his
sister's shoulder, where he had hidden it in the
first moment of terror. His eyes were big with
fright, and his lips trembled pitifully.</p>

<p>"Never mind about me," he faltered. "Maybe
if you get ashore you can send some one after
me. I'm a boy, you know; I ought to be able to
take care of myself."</p>

<p>"You're the bravest boy I ever knew," sobbed
impulsive Lulu, throwing her arms around Jack's
neck, "and we wouldn't leave you for the whole
world, would we, girls?"</p>

<p>"Of course we wouldn't," said Winifred emphatically.
Betty said nothing, but hugged her
brother tight in wordless love and admiration.</p>

<p>"We sha'n't be drowned, any way, I know we
sha'n't," said Lulu, her courage beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161">161</a></span>
rise. "There are so many boats on the river
that some one will be sure to see us pretty soon."</p>

<p>"There's a man over there fishing on that
dock," cried Winifred hopefully. "He isn't
looking this way, but maybe if we shout very loud
he'll hear us."</p>

<p>The four little voices were accordingly raised,
and shout succeeded shout till the opposite bank
sent back the echoes, but the fisherman never
turned his head. Perhaps he was deaf, or possibly
he was accustomed to hear children shouting in
that way, merely for the sake of amusement. Not
another human being was in sight.</p>

<p>"He won't see us, oh, he won't look," moaned
Winifred, once more beginning to cry. "See
how far away from the shore we are getting.
Oh, we shall be drowned, I know we shall."</p>

<p>Betty and Lulu had also noticed how fast the
boat was drifting.</p>

<p>"The tide's going out," whispered Betty, with
white lips. "Where does this river go to, Lulu?"</p>

<p>"Into the ocean, I think," said Lulu, shivering.
"It has to go round Sandy Hook first, though,"
she added more hopefully, "and somebody will
be sure to see us before we get there."</p>

<p>"Are you very frightened, Jack, dear?" Betty
whispered, nestling close to her little brother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162">162</a></span></p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, not so very," returned Jack tremulously;
"only&mdash;only, if anything does happen
think how unhappy mother will be, and&mdash;and, I
did hope I should be able to walk just like other
people."</p>

<p>This was too much for Betty, and she promptly
burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, we must do something, we must," cried
Lulu, almost beside herself with anxiety. "It's
all my fault, I know, but I really did think it was
safe. I didn't mean to be naughty, I truly didn't,
Winifred."</p>

<p>"I know you didn't," sobbed Winifred, hugging
her friend in a burst of remorse. "I didn't
mean what I said, not a single word of it, only
I was so dreadfully frightened."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if we keep on shouting all the time,
and waving our handkerchiefs, some one will
notice us," Betty suggested.</p>

<p>This seemed a good idea, and was promptly
acted upon, but though they shouted till their
throats were sore, and waved till their arms
ached, no friendly face appeared, and faster and
faster drifted the little boat away from home
and friends.</p>

<p>"I wonder what time it is," said Winifred,
when they had at last left off shouting, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163">163</a></span>
gain a little breath. "It seems as if we had been
out on the river for hours and hours."</p>

<p>"We can't have been as long as that," said
Betty, "because the sun is just as bright as it was
when we started. I guess the time seems longer
than it really is."</p>

<p>"I wonder where our mothers are now," remarked
Lulu mournfully. "Mine must be on
the boat coming home from the city."</p>

<p>"And mine is driving with Mrs. Martin," said
Winifred. "Oh, what will they all do when they
get home and we're not there." The picture
called up by this remark was too dreadful to be
borne with fortitude, and all four children simultaneously
burst into tears.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jack's voice broke in upon the wails
of the three little girls.</p>

<p>"Look, oh, look! there's a steamboat; it's coming
this way."</p>

<p>Every eye was turned in the direction Jack
pointed. Sure enough, a large steam yacht was
coming rapidly down the river, her head pointed
straight towards them.</p>

<p>"Wave, keep waving as hard as you can," cried
Betty excitedly. "Let's all shout together again,
and perhaps they'll hear us."</p>

<p>"Wait till they get a little nearer, they couldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164">164</a></span>
hear us yet," advised Jack. "Oh, do you really
think they'll save us?"</p>

<p>"Of course they will," said Lulu confidently.
"Oh, look, look, they see us already; there's a
man waving back to us. Maybe they think we're
only doing it for fun. How shall we let them
know we want them to help us?"</p>

<p>"We must shout," said Betty, and she set the
example by raising her voice to its highest pitch.</p>

<p>"Please, please help us! Our boat's drifting,
and we haven't got any oars. Oh, please, do come
and help us!"</p>

<p>"They understand us!" cried Lulu joyfully.
"See, the man's nodding his head. Why, they're
stopping! Oh, don't you believe they're going
to help us after all?"</p>

<p>For the next few moments the children waited
in breathless suspense, almost too excited to speak.
Then Jack announced:</p>

<p>"They're getting into a rowboat. See those
two men? That's the one that nodded to us; I
guess he's the captain. Let's shout again."</p>

<p>So again the four little voices were raised in
agonized appeal, and this time there came an
answering shout from the other boat.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, children, you're all right.
We're coming to you as fast as we can."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165">165</a></span></p>

<p>The wind brought the cheery, encouraging
words straight across the water to the terrified
children, and oh! the relief of that comforting
assurance to each wildly beating little heart. The
men in the boat rowed fast, and soon the splash
of approaching oars was heard. Lulu and Winifred
began to cry again, but it was for joy this
time, not sorrow. Betty and Jack clung to each
other in speechless relief. In a few moments the
two boats were side by side; a rope was thrown
securely around the oarless craft, and the children
were safe.</p>

<p>"And now, my little friends, you must let us
take you on board the yacht," said the man whom
Jack had concluded to be the captain.</p>

<p>He was a tall, broad-shouldered man, with a
rather handsome face, and it seemed to the children
as though his cheery voice was the pleasantest
sound they had ever heard in their lives. He
and his companion&mdash;who appeared to be one of
the sailors&mdash;began at once rowing back towards
the yacht, keeping the children's boat in tow. A
sudden fit of shyness had fallen upon the party,
and nobody spoke until the stranger inquired, regarding
the solemn little faces rather quizzically:</p>

<p>"How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"We were playing in the boat," Betty explained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166">166</a></span>
"It was fastened to the dock, and we
thought it was safe. The chain broke and we
hadn't any oars."</p>

<p>"Have you been drifting long? Were you
very much frightened?"</p>

<p>"It seemed like a long time," said Betty, "and
we were pretty frightened. It was very kind of
you to come and help us."</p>

<p>The gentleman smiled. He was a gentleman,
the children all felt sure of that, and Lulu afterwards
remarked that he had the most beautiful
smile she had ever seen.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said until they reached the
side of the yacht. Several men, evidently members
of the crew, were standing on the deck,
watching with interest the approach of the two
boats.</p>

<p>"Now," said the gentleman, rising, "do you
think you can manage to climb this ladder? It's
perfectly safe, and I will help you."</p>

<p>Lulu and Winifred rose promptly, but Betty
remained seated, her arm around her little
brother.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," said the gentleman encouragingly;
"it's quite easy."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not afraid," said Betty, her lip beginning
to quiver, "but I can't leave my brother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167">167</a></span>
He can't climb. He has always been a cripple
until this summer, and he's only just beginning
to walk now. We'll have to stay here till we get
to the landing."</p>

<p>While Betty was speaking the stranger's face
had softened wonderfully, and he looked at Jack
with an expression of increased interest. Without
a word he stepped to the side of his own boat,
and, leaning over, lifted the little boy in his arms.</p>

<p>"Now I fancy we can manage it, my little
man," he said kindly, and in another moment he
had lifted Jack up to one of the men on the yacht,
who in turn had placed the child in safety on the
deck. The little girls were then carefully helped
up the ladder, and in less than three minutes the
whole party was standing, safe and dry, on the
deck of what they afterwards learned to be one
of the finest steam yachts in the world.</p>

<p>"And now I shall have to take you all as far
as the steamboat landing," said the stranger, as
he placed Jack comfortably in a steamer chair.
"It will not take more than half an hour, and
from there we can easily send word to your
friends. Where do you live, by the way?"</p>

<p>"We live at Navesink," said Lulu, suddenly
recovering her speech and her manners now that
the danger was over, and remembering all at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168">168</a></span>
that she had always been considered a very polite
little girl. "My papa has a cottage there, and
the others all came over to spend the afternoon
with me. It was my fault about the boat, but I
thought it was safe. I think we must have made
it rock too much when we were playing shipwreck."</p>

<p>"Very possibly," said the gentleman, who
looked considerably amused by this explanation.
"It is never a very wise plan to make boats rock
too much. But now let me see"&mdash;glancing at his
watch&mdash;"it is only a little after five, and we shall
be at the landing by half-past. Do you think
your friends will be very much frightened about
you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Lulu. "My mother
has gone to the city for the day; Winifred's
mother is out driving, and Betty and Jack say
their mother told them they needn't come home
before six. My papa has a telephone, and we
can let them know as soon as we get to the
landing."</p>

<p>"Not at all a bad idea, and in the meantime
won't you make yourselves at home on board my
yacht? By the way, I think shipwrecked people
are apt to be hungry."</p>

<p>"We are not very hungry, thank you," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169">169</a></span>
Lulu politely; "you see, we didn't start until half-past
three."</p>

<p>The stranger smiled again, and said something
in a low tone to the steward, who immediately
disappeared.</p>

<p>"We've none of us ever been on a yacht before,"
said Lulu, feeling that it was her duty to
keep up the conversation, as none of the others
seemed inclined to talk. "I think it's a very nice
place."</p>

<p>"I have crossed the Atlantic in this yacht," the
gentleman said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Have you really?" exclaimed Lulu, looking
very much surprised. "I didn't know people
ever did that, except perhaps lords."</p>

<p>"And why lords in particular?" the stranger
inquired, smiling.</p>

<p>"I don't know, only a lord is coming to stay
with us, and papa says he has crossed the ocean
in his yacht."</p>

<p>"Indeed! and may I ask what your name is?"</p>

<p>"Lulu Bell. My father is Dr. Bell, and we
live in New York in winter."</p>

<p>"Well, this is a coincidence, I declare," exclaimed
the gentleman, looking really quite excited.
"I had no idea that one of the children
in that rowboat would prove to be the little daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170">170</a></span>
of my old friend. Have you ever heard your
father speak of Lord Carresford?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Lulu, her eyes opening wide
in astonishment; "he's the lord that's coming to
stay with us to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I am Lord Carresford," said the gentleman,
laughing and holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Children," gasped Lulu, turning to her three
companions, who had been whispering together
at a little distance from their rescuer and herself,
and who had not paid much attention to the conversation,
"oh, children, the very most wonderful
thing has happened. This really is a lord's yacht,
and this gentleman is&mdash;'His Lordship.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>"HIS LORDSHIP"</h3>

<p>Before the children had fully recovered
from the amazement caused by Lulu's announcement
the steward reappeared bearing
a tray containing lemonade and cake, and Lord
Carresford requested them to take some refreshments.
Although not in a starving condition,
they were all blessed with healthy appetites, and
the cake and lemonade disappeared very rapidly.
While they ate their host talked to them, and he
was so pleasant and merry, and, in fact, talked
so much like any other gentleman, that Winifred
whispered to Jack: "Betty was right, wasn't she?
A lord isn't a bit different from anybody else,"
to which Jack replied, "No, only rather nicer than
most people, don't you think so?"</p>

<p>By the time the impromptu repast was finished
the yacht had reached the steamboat landing, and
Lord Carresford hurried away to the telephone
office to inform Dr. and Mrs. Bell of their little
daughter's whereabouts. During his absence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172">172</a></span>
steward&mdash;who appeared to be a very agreeable
person&mdash;showed the children over the yacht,
carrying Jack in his arms almost as tenderly and
carefully as his master had done.</p>

<p>"I think a yacht is the most interesting place
I have ever been in," Lulu informed "his lordship"
on his return from the telephone office.
"I should like very much indeed to cross the
ocean in one. We went to Europe once, and I
liked the steamer very much, but mamma and
Aunt Daisy were seasick."</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," interrupted Betty&mdash;"I
mean, your lordship&mdash;do you know whether our
families have been very much worried about us?"</p>

<p>"I think not," said "his lordship," smiling
kindly at the earnest little face. "Dr. Bell himself
came to the telephone, and seemed greatly surprised
to learn of the state of affairs. He and his
wife have just returned from the city, and had
not yet discovered that their little girl was missing.
He says he will drive over to the landing
for you at once."</p>

<p>Betty drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," she said; "I was afraid mother
might be frightened. She was very ill last spring,
and we shouldn't like to have her worried about
anything."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173">173</a></span></p>

<p>After that Lord Carresford took them down
into the cabin and showed them some interesting
shells and other curious things which he had collected
during his wanderings. He had been
nearly all over the world, it seemed, and was certainly
one of the most fascinating "grown-ups"
the children had ever met. So the moments flew,
and almost before any one could have believed
such a thing possible, Dr. Bell arrived with the
carriage. At sight of her father Lulu suddenly
burst into tears again and flung herself impulsively
into his arms.</p>

<p>"I wasn't naughty, papa, I really wasn't," she
sobbed. "I did think the boat was safe or I
wouldn't have asked the others in. Oh, papa,
dear, you won't be angry, will you?"</p>

<p>"No, no, little woman," Dr. Bell said, kissing
her. "I am only angry with myself for not having
been more careful. If anything had happened&mdash;Jack,
old fellow, how can I thank you?"
And the doctor wrung Lord Carresford's hands
in gratitude too deep for words.</p>

<p>The greeting between the two old friends was
a very hearty one, and Dr. Bell would have insisted
on Lord Carresford's returning with them
at once to Navesink, but the latter explained that
he had promised to dine with some friends at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174">174</a></span>
Highlands that evening, and would consequently
be unable to arrive at the Bells' before the following
day. It was getting late, and as Dr. Bell
was anxious to get his party home as soon as possible,
the good-byes and thanks were quickly said
and the four children were packed into the Bells'
comfortable depot wagon. Lord Carresford insisted
on carrying Jack to the carriage.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my small friend," he said kindly,
as he tucked the laprobe about the little boy's feet.
"I shall see you again, I hope, when I come to
Navesink."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, sir, and thank you very much,"
said Jack, holding out his hand. "I am very glad
I met you. I have wanted for a long time to meet
a lord, but I didn't really believe I ever should."</p>

<p>It was nearly eight o'clock before the party
reached home, and Dr. Bell drove at once to the
boarding-house to leave Betty and Jack. Mrs.
Randall was standing on the piazza gazing
anxiously out into the gathering dusk.</p>

<p>"Here we are, mother," called Betty, as the
carriage drew up before the door; "we're all
right, and I'm sure Jack hasn't taken cold."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall hurried down the steps, and took
Jack in her arms.</p>

<p>"Let me carry him," she said almost sharply<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175">175</a></span>
to the doctor, who would have lifted the child
from the carriage. "Oh, my little boy, were you
very, very much frightened?"</p>

<p>"I was pretty frightened at first," Jack admitted,
with his arms clasped tight around his
mother's neck, "but afterwards, when the yacht
came, and the lord was so kind, I liked it, and
then it was a great comfort to know you weren't
frightened about us."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you were warm enough all the
time?" Mrs. Randall questioned anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, as warm as toast," said Jack, laughing.
"They wrapped me all up in the laprobe
driving home&mdash;and see this pretty silk handkerchief.
The lord tied it around my neck for fear
I should be cold."</p>

<p>"The lord?" repeated Mrs. Randall, looking
very much puzzled.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, the lord that owns the yacht&mdash;and
isn't it funny, mother, he's the same lord
that's coming to stay at Dr. Bell's. He said he
hoped he should see me again, and I hope so too,
for he is the nicest gentleman I ever met."</p>

<p>"Mother," said Jack an hour later, when his
mother was putting him to bed, "do you know,
I'm more glad than I ever was before that I'm an
English boy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176">176</a></span></p>

<p>"Why?" his mother asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"Because when I grow up I shall be an Englishman,
and I do think Englishmen are very
splendid. I like Dr. Bell, and Mr. Hamilton, and
a good many other American gentlemen, but I
never saw any one quite so splendid as that lord."</p>

<p>Mrs. Randall laughed.</p>

<p>"You enthusiastic little hero worshiper," she
said. "What was the lord's name, by the way?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Jack; "Lulu just called
him 'your lordship.' They might have names
like other people, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, and it isn't customary to address
a lord as 'your lordship' either, at least not
among people of our class."</p>

<p>"That must be why he laughed when Lulu did
it," said Betty reflectively, "but she only wanted
to be very respectful. Dr. Bell called him Jack."</p>

<p>"Betty," whispered Jack, when their mother
had left the room, and the two children were alone
together, "do you suppose we shall ever see
Uncle Jack?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Betty sadly. "I'm sure
mother never will write to him, and of course he
wouldn't be likely to come to America."</p>

<p>"You don't know where he lives in England,
do you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177">177</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother told me once, but I forget the name
of the place. Why do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Jack slowly, raising himself
on his elbow as he spoke, "if I knew it, I think I
would write him a letter myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, you wouldn't dare?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I would," said Jack, "and I
think if he really came, mother would love it."</p>

<p>"She would love to see him," Betty admitted,
"but she doesn't like to write, for fear he might
think she wanted money or something like that."</p>

<p>"I want to see him too," said Jack; "I want it
very much indeed."</p>

<p>"Why? You never seemed to care so much
before."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't, not till to-day, but then you see
I had never talked to an Englishman before."</p>

<p>"And does that make a difference?" Betty
asked, somewhat puzzled.</p>

<p>"Of course it does. Uncle Jack is an Englishman
too, and perhaps&mdash;I don't really suppose he
is&mdash;but he might be just a little bit like the lord."</p>

<p>"You are a funny boy," said Betty, laughing.
"The lord was very kind, and ever so good to us,
but then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was the most splendid man I ever saw,"
interrupted Jack, "and I wish&mdash;I do wish&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178">178</a></span>
when I grow up I might be just exactly like
him."</p>

<p>The Randalls was not the only household in
which Lord Carresford was the subject of conversation
that evening.</p>

<p>"Your friend has certainly succeeded in captivating
the children's affections, Charlie," said
Mrs. Bell to her husband, as she joined him and
her sister on the piazza after having seen Lulu
safely tucked up in bed. "Lulu has talked of
nothing else since she came home, and I have just
been talking to Mrs. Hamilton at the telephone.
She says her little girl is of the opinion that 'his
lordship' is the most delightful person she has
ever encountered."</p>

<p>"That was always the way with old Jack," said
the doctor, smiling. "There was never a man,
woman, or child who had not something to say in
his praise. He was the most popular man in his
class."</p>

<p>"I declare I can hardly wait till to-morrow to
make his acquaintance," laughed Miss Warren.
"Did you ever know any of his people, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"No, I never met any of them. I fancy his
father was a rather eccentric old gentleman, who
did not encourage visitors. There was a sister
he used to talk about a good deal, but I never met<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179">179</a></span>
her. I left college the year before he did, and
I have a vague recollection of having heard that
the sister made an unfortunate marriage, but I
have forgotten the circumstances."</p>

<p>"I hope that poor little Randall boy won't be
any the worse for his adventure of this afternoon,"
Mrs. Bell said, a little anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I think not; we wrapped him up well
coming home, and he seemed as happy as possible.
Indeed, I have an idea that he rather enjoyed the
whole adventure, for he is a true boy, after all."</p>

<p>"I like Mrs. Randall very much," remarked
Miss Warren. "She is an excellent teacher, and
a thoroughly cultivated woman. I wish I knew
more of her history, and could do something to
help her, for I am sure she has had a hard time.
Don't you know anything about her family,
Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever. Betty once told me that
their only relative is an uncle in England, whom
she has never seen."</p>

<p>"Lulu says Jack's grandfather was a general,"
said Mrs. Bell. "They are certainly a most interesting
family, and I wish we could manage to do
something for that poor Mrs. Randall. There is
a tragedy of some kind written plainly on her
face."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>JACK'S NEW FRIEND</h3>

<p>"May I inquire what you are thinking of
so intently, Miss Lulu?"</p>

<p>Lulu gave a little start, and glanced
up from her seat on the piazza steps, into Lord
Carresford's kind, amused face. "His lordship,"
stretched comfortably in the hammock,
with book and cigar, had been regarding her in
silence for several minutes.</p>

<p>"I was thinking," said Lulu slowly, "how differently
things generally happen from the way
you expect them to."</p>

<p>"I thought it must be something rather absorbing,"
said "his lordship" with a smile, "you
looked so very serious. What has put that particular
thought into your head just now, I wonder."</p>

<p>"Why, it was you," said Lulu, flushing a little.
"I began by thinking how different you were
from what we thought you were going to be.
When papa said a lord was coming to stay with
us, I was really quite uncomfortable. I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181">181</a></span>
it would be such a dreadfully solemn thing to
have one in the house."</p>

<p>Lord Carresford laughed.</p>

<p>"And you have since discovered that I am not
such a very solemn person after all, is that it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lulu; "you're not the least bit
solemn, you know, but much nicer than any other
gentleman who ever came to stay with us. It's
only two days since you came, but it seems as if
we'd all known you a long time. Betty said she
didn't believe lords were any different from other
people, but the rest of us all thought they must
be."</p>

<p>"Good for Betty. How did she obtain her
superior knowledge about lords?"</p>

<p>"She said the lords in books were just like other
people, and then I suppose being English made
her know a little more about such things, though
she's never been in England herself."</p>

<p>"English," repeated Lord Carresford in surprise;
"I did not know that the Hamiltons were
English."</p>

<p>"They're not, but Betty isn't Mrs. Hamilton's
little girl. Did you think she was Winifred's
sister?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did think so; and the little lame boy&mdash;isn't
he a Hamilton either?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182">182</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Lulu, laughing; "Winifred
hasn't any brothers or sisters at all. She and I
are great friends, but we haven't known Betty and
Jack very long. They lived in the same apartment
house with Winifred in New York, and she
got acquainted with them in the spring. Their
mother was very ill, and papa attended her. Jack
couldn't walk at all then, but papa thought he
might be cured, so he went to a hospital, and had
an operation. They came down here, because
papa thought the sea air would do Jack good.
They're staying at Mrs. Wilson's boarding
house, and their mother gives music lessons.
We're growing very fond of Betty and Jack,
and I mean to have them for my friends
always."</p>

<p>"I took quite a fancy to Jack myself," said
Lord Carresford; "he struck me as a rather remarkable
little fellow."</p>

<p>Lulu's face brightened.</p>

<p>"I'm very glad," she said, "because Jack is so
anxious to know you. Betty says he thinks you
are the loveliest gentleman he has ever seen. He
talks about you all the time and when he and
Betty came over here yesterday, and I told him
you had gone driving with papa, he looked dreadfully
disappointed."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183">183</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Carresford seemed both pleased and
amused.</p>

<p>"I must make a point of looking up my young
friend, and having a little talk with him then," he
said. "Do you suppose he is to be found on the
beach this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know he is; I saw Betty wheeling him
down a little while ago. I'm waiting for Winifred,
and then we're going too. I suppose you
wouldn't care to go with us? It's very nice and
cool down there."</p>

<p>"I think I should like it very much," said Lord
Carresford, smiling. "Your father will not be
at home before six, I believe."</p>

<p>"No, and mamma and Aunt Daisy have gone
to a tea. Don't you like teas, Lord Carresford?"</p>

<p>"Not very much. I prefer sitting here and
watching the ocean. Do you enjoy teas yourself?"</p>

<p>"I think I should like them," said Lulu reflectively;
"I like most grown-up things. Betty
says she wants to be a housekeeper when she
grows up, but I should much rather be an authoress.
Aunt Daisy is an authoress, you know, and
people always like to talk to her. Jack is going
to be an artist when he grows up, and he doesn't
want Betty to be a housekeeper, because he says<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184">184</a></span>
English ladies never work. Jack is really a very
unselfish little boy. That day in the boat he
wanted us all to wade ashore and leave him alone.
He said he was a boy, and ought to be able to
take care of himself. We think him very brave,
and papa calls him a little soldier. Oh, here comes
Winifred." And Lulu sprang to her feet, and
hurried across the lawn to greet her friend.</p>

<p>Winifred was very much impressed when her
friend informed her in a whisper that "his lordship"
was actually going to the beach with them,
and the three were soon on their way.</p>

<p>"Lord Carresford," said Lulu rather timidly, as
they passed out of the gate, and turned in the direction
of the board walk, "would you mind very
much if I asked you a question?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>"Do you like being a lord?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can scarcely say that I dislike it," said
"his lordship," laughing. "The fact is, I don't
think I have quite recovered from the surprise of
the whole thing as yet."</p>

<p>"Why were you surprised? Didn't you always
expect to be one?"</p>

<p>"I never even dreamed of such a thing until
about a year ago. My uncle was Lord Carresford
as long as he lived, and when he died the title<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185">185</a></span>
naturally descended to his son, my cousin. He
had always been very strong and well, but he died
suddenly of pneumonia a year ago last spring,
and as he was not married, and I was the nearest
male relative, the title and estates came to me."</p>

<p>"That's just the way it was with little Lord
Fauntleroy," said Winifred, much struck by the
coincidence, "and he didn't think he was going
to like it at first, but afterwards he didn't mind
so much. Have you got a beautiful castle in
England, like the one Fauntleroy had?"</p>

<p>"I have several rather nice places. If you ever
come to England you must make me a visit at
Carresford Towers. You would like that, I
think; it is very pretty."</p>

<p>"We should like it very much," said Winifred
politely. "I wish Jack could go to England some
time; he's so much interested in all English
things. Have you got a park with deer in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a very nice one."</p>

<p>"And who will be Lord Carresford when you&mdash;after
you get through?" Lulu inquired, finding
some difficulty in framing her question in the
most delicate manner.</p>

<p>Lord Carresford laughed.</p>

<p>"That depends upon circumstances," he said.
"If I should happen to marry and have a son, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186">186</a></span>
would naturally take my place. Otherwise the
title would go to one of my nephews, if I had
any."</p>

<p>"Have you got any nephews now?" Lulu
asked.</p>

<p>"No, at least none that I know of. I have two
married sisters in England, but their children all
happen to be girls."</p>

<p>"It's all very interesting," said Lulu; "it
sounds just like a thing out of a book. There are
Betty and Jack sitting on the bathing house steps.
Won't they be surprised when they see who is
with us?"</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, and how have you been amusing
yourself to-day?" Lord Carresford asked
kindly, seating himself beside Jack on the steps,
as the three little girls strolled away in search of
other amusements.</p>

<p>"I've been having a very pleasant time, sir,"
said Jack, whose heart was beating faster than
was quite comfortable, and whose cheeks were
flushing and paling by turns. To find himself actually
alone with "the lord," engaged in familiar
conversation with him, was an honor he had never
even dreamed of. "Betty and I were on the
beach all the morning. I like it better than any
other place."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187">187</a></span></p>

<p>"You are fond of the sea, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed, I love just to sit and look at
it. It's very interesting to look at things, don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I suppose it is, though I can't
say I have ever thought very much on the subject."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it's rather different with me,"
Jack explained in his odd, old-fashioned way,
"because until this summer I never saw many
things. I hardly ever went out, and you know
one can't see very much from back windows, especially
when one lives on the top floor."</p>

<p>"I should not imagine the view could have
been very interesting," said Lord Carresford,
smiling; "but how did it happen that you so seldom
went out?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, I was too heavy to carry, and of
course we couldn't afford to have a carriage. I
did go in a carriage once, though; I saw Central
Park." And Jack launched forth into a description
of Winifred's invitation, and his birthday
treat. Lord Carresford began to look really interested.</p>

<p>"And how did you amuse yourself all day in
the house?" he inquired, rather curiously, when
Jack had finished his story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188">188</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I got on very well. I read a good deal,
and drew pictures, and then Betty was always
there, and mother came home in the afternoons.
You never heard my mother play on the piano,
did you?"</p>

<p>"No, I have never had the pleasure of meeting
your mother."</p>

<p>"I think she plays better than any one else in
the world," said Jack simply. "She used to
play for me every evening, because she knew I
loved it, though sometimes she was dreadfully
tired. Oh, I had very good times, though of
course it is much nicer here."</p>

<p>"Did you say you drew pictures?" Lord Carresford
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I like to draw better than almost anything
else, but I don't suppose I do it at all
right. I've been making a picture this afternoon."</p>

<p>"May I look at it? I am very much interested
in pictures."</p>

<p>Jack produced a folded paper from his pocket,
which he handed to Lord Carresford.</p>

<p>"I was going to take it home to mother," he
explained; "she likes to keep all my pictures."</p>

<p>Lord Carresford unfolded the paper, and
glanced, at first rather carelessly, at the rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189">189</a></span>
little sketch. Then suddenly his expression
changed, and when he again turned to the little
boy there was a new interest in his manner.</p>

<p><span><a name="image8" id="image8"></a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image8.jpg" width="400" height="639" alt="image8" title="image8" style="border: 1px solid" />
<span class="caption">"It is very good," said Lord Carresford.&mdash;<i>Page 189</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>"Who taught you to draw?" he asked rather
abruptly.</p>

<p>"No one," said Jack; "I just did it. My father
was an artist, and mother thinks that may be the
reason why I can do it. Please, sir, would you
mind telling me if it's very bad?"</p>

<p>"It is very good," said Lord Carresford
heartily; "remarkably good for a boy of your
age. You will be an artist when you grow up,
or I am much mistaken."</p>

<p>Jack's face was radiant.</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?" he asked breathlessly.
"Oh, I'm so glad. I should like so very,
very much to be an artist."</p>

<p>"Why are you so anxious on the subject?"
Lord Carresford asked, with a kindly glance at
the flushed, eager little face.</p>

<p>"I think it's partly because my father was
one, but mostly because I want to make money,"
said Jack.</p>

<p>"You want to make money, eh? and what
will you do with the money when it is made?"</p>

<p>"Why, take care of mother and Betty, of
course," said Jack, surprised at the question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190">190</a></span>
"Isn't that what men always do with the
money they make?&mdash;take care of their families,
I mean."</p>

<p>"Well, I am afraid not always," said Lord
Carresford, laughing; "don't you think that you
may need a share for yourself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not much," said Jack confidently. "You
see, I shall always live with mother and Betty, and
if they have things, why, of course I shall have
them too. I don't want mother to give music lessons
when I grow up, and Betty mustn't be a
housekeeper, though she says she would like to
be one."</p>

<p>"Have you a particular objection to housekeepers,
then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it isn't that, only I don't think&mdash;Lord
Carresford, would you mind telling me
something?"</p>

<p>"Not at all; what is it?"</p>

<p>"It's about ladies," said Jack, flushing;
"English ladies I mean. They never work, do
they?"</p>

<p>"Many of them do when it is necessary. There
is nothing to be ashamed of in honest work, you
know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know there isn't. Mother works, and
Lulu's aunt writes books. But I mean the kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191">191</a></span>
of ladies who have lords for their relations&mdash;do
they ever work?"</p>

<p>"Well, they are not very often obliged to, but
I have known of cases where even ladies of title
have supported themselves. I see your point,
though; you don't want your sister to be obliged
to work."</p>

<p>"No," said Jack; "not if I can take care of
her. I want her to live in a beautiful place, with
a park, like mother&mdash;I mean like some people&mdash;and
never have to do anything she doesn't want
to."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lord Carresford, smiling, "I am
not certain about the park, but you ought to be
able to make a comfortable home for your mother
and sister. You have talent, my boy, and it
should be cultivated. You must have lessons."</p>

<p>Jack's bright face clouded.</p>

<p>"Don't lessons cost a good deal, sir?" he
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, but in a case like yours I don't think
the expense of the thing should be taken into
consideration. A boy who can draw as well as
you can without ever taking a lesson, ought to
have every advantage for improving his talent.
Your mother should place you under one of the
very best teachers in New York, and then when<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192">192</a></span>
you are older you will be able to make good use
of the advantages you have received."</p>

<p>"But if it costs a good deal of money I'm
afraid mother couldn't possibly afford it," said
Jack mournfully. "I shouldn't like to speak to
her about it either, because it might worry her.
When mother's worried about things she doesn't
sleep, and then her eyes look so tired."</p>

<p>Lord Carresford was silent. There was something
rather pathetic in the sight of the little patient
face, that but a moment before had been so
bright and hopeful. This small boy was interesting
him very much. He thought of his own
great wealth, and of how easy it would be to him
to give the child the help he needed. And yet, as
he told himself, it would not do to be too hasty.
He really knew nothing whatever about this
family. So when he spoke again, it was on a different
subject.</p>

<p>The little girls soon returned, and Lulu requested
Lord Carresford to tell them a story.
"His lordship's" powers in that direction had already
been discovered by the little girl. He complied
very willingly with the request, and soon had
the whole party listening in breathless interest to
an account of some of his experiences when hunting
big game in India. So Dr. Bell, coming down<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193">193</a></span>
to the beach on his return from town, found a
very happy little group gathered about his friend,
and it was not without considerable regret that the
children bade good-bye to their fascinating entertainer,
and watched him and the doctor walking
away together.</p>

<p>"That little boy interests me very much,"
Lord Carresford remarked, pausing to light a
cigar, when they had reached the board walk,
"and do you know that he has a great deal of
talent?"</p>

<p>"Talent for what?" the doctor inquired in
surprise.</p>

<p>"Have you never happened to see any of his
sketches?"</p>

<p>"No, never; are they worth anything?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, the child is a genius. He
tells me he has never had a drawing lesson in his
life, and yet, I assure you, his drawings are better
than many I have seen made by students who
have been at work for years. He ought to have
the best teaching that can be procured."</p>

<p>Dr. Bell looked interested.</p>

<p>"I am afraid there may be difficulties in the
way," he said. "The mother is a music teacher,
and I am sorry to say is far from strong. I fancy
she has a rather uphill road to travel."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194">194</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, she ought to be told of her boy's talent
at any rate," said Lord Carresford, rather impatiently.
"The raising of sufficient money for lessons
ought not to be difficult. I am sure I should
be very glad to contribute myself to so good a
cause."</p>

<p>"It might not be difficult in some cases," said
the doctor, laughing, "but I am afraid that in
that particular case there would be a good deal of
trouble. The mother has the airs and manner of
a queen. I should like to see her expression if
any one were to propose to her that a fund should
be raised in order to give her small boy drawing
lessons. I have never yet been able to muster
sufficient courage to explain to her that I do not
intend sending in a bill for professional services.
She was laid up with a sharp attack of pneumonia
this spring. When she was taken ill she told her
children she could not afford to have a doctor sent
for. Fortunately Hamilton's little girl, who happened
to be a friend of theirs, took matters into
her own hands, in the absence of her mother, and
came for me. The poor woman was delirious
when I reached there, and we had a hard time to
pull her through. I believe that if it were not for
the children she would starve rather than accept
a penny from any one. She adores them, though,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195">195</a></span>
especially the boy, and no wonder, for he is one of
the finest little fellows I have ever seen."</p>

<p>"Poor soul," said Lord Carresford, with a
sigh. "Well, she must be told of her boy's prospects,
and then she can do as she likes about accepting
the necessary aid."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>SOMETHING HAPPENS</h3>

<p>"Is it finished, Winifred?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;yes," said Winifred slowly, laying
down her pencil, and surveying rather
ruefully the large sheet of foolscap in her lap.
"It's finished, but it isn't any good; I know your
aunt won't like it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she will," said Lulu encouragingly,
coming over to her friend's side, and surveying
the result of her labors with evident satisfaction.
The two little girls were together in Lulu's room,
and for the past half-hour Winifred had been
making a desperate effort to finish her story.</p>

<p>"It isn't as long as mine," Lulu went on,
"But I think it's a very pretty story. 'The
Indian' is a nice name, isn't it? I've called
mine 'The Discovery of New Haven.' Of
course I don't mean the New Haven where the
Boston trains stop. It's just an imaginary place,
you know. We must go and read our stories to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197">197</a></span>
Aunt Daisy now. I'm just crazy to know how
she will like them."</p>

<p>Winifred hesitated.</p>

<p>"I know she'll think mine dreadfully silly,"
she said. "Don't you think you could possibly
read it to her after I go home?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Lulu with decision;
"you must read it to her yourself, the same as
I do. Come along."</p>

<p>Winifred rose rather reluctantly, and the two
little girls went downstairs, and out on the
piazza, where they found Lord Carresford and
Miss Warren sitting together. "His lordship"
was reading aloud to the blind lady, but at the
children's approach he laid down his book.</p>

<p>"Well, young ladies," he said pleasantly,
"and what have you been doing all the
morning?"</p>

<p>"Winifred has been finishing her story," said
Lulu, "and I've been making a bureau cover for
the fair. We came down to read our stories to
Aunt Daisy, but if you're reading to her now
we can go away, and do it another time."</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said Lord Carresford, "I am
sure Miss Warren would much prefer your reading
to mine, but may I not be permitted to hear
the stories too?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198">198</a></span></p>

<p>Lulu hesitated, and glanced at Winifred.</p>

<p>"We don't usually like to have grown-up
people read our things," she said doubtfully,
"but you've been so very kind to us&mdash;shall we do
it, Winifred?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather go home, and let you read them
both," said Winifred, with a rather wistful glance
in the direction of the distant hotel. "I guess
I'd better go home, any way. Mother's very busy
sewing for the fair, and she might want me to
help her, you know."</p>

<p>"No, she won't," said Lulu confidently;
"mamma is with her, and grown-up ladies always
like to be by themselves when they sew, don't they,
Aunt Daisy?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I am sure," said Miss Warren,
laughing, "but I really think Winifred had better
stay here. You ought not to mind letting Lord
Carresford hear your story, Winnie; think of all
the stories he has told you himself."</p>

<p>"Yes, and remember how kind he was that day
on the yacht," put in Lulu. "If he hadn't come to
help us we might have all been drowned. I think
we each ought to do something to give him
pleasure."</p>

<p>"But it wouldn't give him pleasure to hear my
silly old story," Winifred protested, blushing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199">199</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Carresford insisted, however, that nothing
could possibly give him greater pleasure at
that moment, and Winifred, being a very good-natured,
obliging little girl, made no further objections,
only begging that Lulu's story might be
read first. So the two little girls settled themselves
comfortably on the piazza steps, and their
elders prepared to listen.</p>

<p>"My story is called 'The Discovery of New
Haven,'" remarked Lulu, with an air of pride, as
she unfolded her manuscript. "Shall I begin
now, Aunt Daisy?"</p>

<p>Miss Warren nodded; Lord Carresford lighted
a cigar, and Lulu began.</p>


<h3>"THE DISCOVERY OF NEW HAVEN</h3>

<p>"Once there were two little girls, whose names
were Lillie and Violet. Their home was in a
beautiful country place called Haven. Lillie and
Violet each had a pony of her own, besides a
great many other wonderful things, including
gardens, rabbits, and beautiful toys. Their father
and mother were very good, religious people, and
though they were rich themselves, they were not
forgetful of the poor. They wished their little
girls to grow up to be noble women.</p>

<p>"One evening after Lillie and Violet had gone
to bed, and their father and mother&mdash;whose
names were Mr. and Mrs. Lafayette&mdash;were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200">200</a></span>
sitting together in their beautiful parlor all furnished
in velvet and gold, Mr. Lafayette suddenly
paused in the middle of a piece he was
playing on the pianola, and said:</p>

<p>"'My dear, I have thought of a most beautiful
plan. Let us go to the city to-morrow, and look
for two little poor children, and bring them home
with us to be companions to our little girls. It
is time they began to learn to make other people
happy.'</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lafayette was delighted with this suggestion,
and the next morning they started for
the city.</p>

<p>"The scene now changes to a dirty, crowded
city street&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Don't you think that's a nice expression, Aunt
Daisy, 'the scene now changes'? I got it out of
'Tales from Scott.'"</p>

<p>"It sounds a little like Scott, I think," Miss
Warren said, smiling, and Lulu went on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The scene now changes to a dirty, crowded
city street, where Joe and Nannie, two poor little
beggar children, were busily engaged in selling
matches and shoe lacings. Joe and Nannie were
very poor indeed. Their father and mother were
dead, and ever since they were two and three
years old they had been obliged to take care of
themselves. They did not even sleep in a house,
but generally passed their nights in areas with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201">201</a></span>
their heads pillowed on the cold stone steps. It
was often very uncomfortable, especially in
winter, but they were very brave, cheerful children,
and no one had ever heard one word of
complaint from their lips. They were also very
clean, and would often go to the free baths
without being told.</p>

<p>"One very hot day in summer, when Joe and
Nannie were standing on a corner, wishing most
earnestly that some one would stop and buy their
matches and shoe lacings a car suddenly stopped
just in front of them and an elegantly dressed
lady and gentleman got out."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Don't you think it was rather poor taste in
the lady and gentleman to be so elegantly dressed
under the circumstances?" Aunt Daisy asked,
with difficulty restraining a desire to laugh.</p>

<p>Lulu looked a little discomfited.</p>

<p>"It sounds pretty," she said. "I really don't
think it matters, Aunt Daisy, as it's only a
story."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The children went up to them and asked them
to please buy some of their things, but the lady,
with a most beautiful smile, said:</p>

<p>"'Come with us, dear children, and we will
take you to a much nicer place than you have
ever seen in your poor, forsaken little lives.'</p>

<p>"Joe and Nannie, wondering very much, followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202">202</a></span>
the elegant lady and gentleman, for they
trusted them at once. When they came to the
station, Mr. Lafayette bought tickets, and then
they all got into the train that was to take them
to Haven. The children had never been in a train
before, and at first they were very much frightened,
but their kind new friends smiled reassuringly
upon them, and their fears were soon
calmed.</p>

<p>"Lillie and Violet were very much surprised
when they saw their father and mother returning
from the city with two strange, ragged children,
but matters were quickly explained to them, and
then Mrs. Lafayette said:</p>

<p>"'We will first take your new companions upstairs,
and dress them in some of your clothes, and
then you may take them for a walk, and show
them some of the beauties of the country they
have come to live in.'</p>

<p>"So when Joe and Nannie had been neatly
dressed, the children all went out together, each
rich child holding the hand of a poor one. Everything
was a joy and a wonder to Joe and Nannie,
and they had never been so happy in their lives.
They walked a long distance, much further than
even Lillie or Violet had ever been before, and at
last they came to a great forest. It was very beautiful,
and so wild that the children loved it, and
they all sat down to rest.</p>

<p>"Suddenly they heard a strange sound; it was
the distant roar of a lion. Lillie and Violet were
frightened, and wanted to run home, but Joe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203">203</a></span>
Nannie looked at each other with shining eyes,
and Joe cried joyfully:</p>

<p>"'That is the roar of a lion, so this must be an
uncivilized country. Perhaps it has never before
been discovered, and if so we have discovered it,
and it will belong to us.'</p>

<p>"Then Joe and Nannie embraced each other,
and they all hurried home.</p>

<p>"When Mr. Lafayette heard of the adventure,
he told them that they had indeed made a great
discovery, for no one had ever before taken possession
of that wild tract of country.</p>

<p>"After that they all went to Washington, and
the President gave Joe a claim to the undiscovered
country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I don't know just what a claim is, but I read
about it in a book.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Then they came back again, and Joe and
Nannie took possession of their vast domain, and
because they wanted to show the Lafayettes how
grateful they were for all their kindness, they
christened their new kingdom, 'New Haven.'
In time they became very rich and powerful, and
Joe married an Indian princess, and Nannie married
a great duke."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You ought to have had Joe marry one of
the Lafayette girls," Lord Carresford said, laughing,
as Lulu paused, and began folding up her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204">204</a></span>
manuscript. "It would have been another little
proof of his gratitude, you know."</p>

<p>"I thought of that," said Lulu, "but an Indian
princess sounded so pretty. Now, Winifred, it's
your turn."</p>

<p>"My story isn't nearly as nice as yours," said
Winifred modestly; "are you sure you really
want me to read it?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure," said Lord Carresford and Miss
Warren both together.</p>

<p>Winifred's cheeks were hot, and her heart
was beating uncomfortably, but she made a
mighty effort to steady her voice, and unfolding
her paper, began to read very fast indeed.</p>


<h3>"THE INDIAN</h3>

<p>"Once upon a time there was a little girl
named Rosalie. She had an older brother named
John, and she had a father but not a mother.</p>

<p>"One day she was in the garden playing with
her brother, when she suddenly saw a very curious-looking
figure coming towards them through
the trees. She paused for a moment in amazement,
and then called, 'Brother.'</p>

<p>"'What is it, Rosalie?' said her brother.</p>

<p>"'What is that, Brother? Look at that awful
thing coming towards us across the field.'</p>

<p>"'That is an Indian, Rosalie. Let us run to
the house, and tell father.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205">205</a></span></p>

<p>"They ran to the house as fast as they could,
and told their father. When their father came out
he said in a stern tone. 'Where is that strange
figure that you saw, Rosalie?'</p>

<p>"Rosalie looked all around, and then said:
'There, father; he is up in that tree. I see his
red blanket.'</p>

<p>"'That is an Indian, Rosalie, coming here to
camp. I will get rid of him. Go into the house,
and do your lessons.'</p>

<p>"So Rosalie went into the house and did her
lessons. When her father came in she asked,
'How did you get rid of him, father?'</p>

<p>"Then her father answered: 'I did not get
rid of him, Rosalie. He was John, the coachman,
coming home from the village with some
red blankets. Neither was it an Indian you saw
in the tree, but only a red heron, and remember,
I do not want you ever again to tell me a thing
until you are quite sure it is true. Now, run off
and play.'&mdash;<span class="smcap">THE END</span>."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A very nice little story," said Miss Warren,
smiling approvingly, as Winifred paused; "I
shall certainly use it in my book."</p>

<p>"I wanted her to make it longer," observed
Lulu regretfully, "but she said she couldn't possibly
think of another word to say."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller"><b>[<span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The above stories were written word for word
by two little girls eight and ten years of age.]</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206">206</a></span></p>

<p>"It has a good moral at any rate," laughed
Lord Carresford, "and that is more than can be
said for every story. Are you going in, Miss
Warren?"</p>

<p>"I have a little writing to do this morning,"
the blind lady explained, rising, and folding up
her knitting as she spoke, "and Mrs. Randall is
coming in half an hour for my music lesson. Are
you going to the beach, Lulu?"</p>

<p>"No; mamma thinks it too hot on the beach
to-day, and Mrs. Hamilton doesn't want Winifred
to go either. We've asked Betty and Jack
over here, and mamma says we may have lemonade
and cookies by and by."</p>

<p>"Lulu," said Lord Carresford, as the screen
door closed behind Miss Warren, "who is Mrs.
Randall?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know? She's Betty and
Jack's mother, and she gives Aunt Daisy music
lessons. She's a splendid music teacher, every
one says so."</p>

<p>"I did not know their name was Randall," said
Lord Carresford, looking interested, though a
little troubled as well. "They are English, are
they not?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Randall is, but Betty and Jack were
born in this country. Their father died when<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207">207</a></span>
Jack was only two, and they were very poor.
Mrs. Randall doesn't like to have them talk about
it; she's a very proud lady."</p>

<p>At that moment Winifred announced that the
Randalls were approaching, and the two little
girls ran off across the lawn to meet their friends.</p>

<p>"Jack," said Lord Carresford, sitting down
beside the little boy, when he had assisted in placing
him comfortably in the big steamer chair,
"did you say anything to your mother about what
I told you yesterday afternoon?"</p>

<p>Jack's eyes fell, and the color rose in his
cheeks.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, sir," he faltered; "I told Betty, and
we decided it would be better not to say anything
to mother about it. You see, she'd be so very
sorry not to be able to let me have the lessons."</p>

<p>"And have you no relations who could afford
to help you&mdash;no uncles or aunts, for instance?"</p>

<p>Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>"We haven't any relations at all," he said
mournfully, "only an uncle in England, and we
don't know him."</p>

<p>"Don't know him, eh; but your mother knows
him, doesn't she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, at least she used to; he's her brother,
you know, but we've never seen him, and mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208">208</a></span>
doesn't like to have us talk much about him, because
it makes her sad."</p>

<p>"What is your uncle's name?" Lord Carresford
spoke quickly, and there was a kind of suppressed
excitement in his manner, which surprised
Jack very much.</p>

<p>"His name is Mr. John Stanhope," said Jack
proudly; "I am named for him. My grandfather
was General Stanhope, and we have another
uncle, who is a&mdash;but, oh, I forgot; mother said
we mustn't talk about him."</p>

<p>Lord Carresford rose hurriedly. He had suddenly
grown very pale.</p>

<p>"Is your mother at home now?" he asked in
a voice so odd and unsteady that Jack stared at
him in growing bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think she is," he said slowly; "she's
coming over here pretty soon to give Miss Warren
her music lesson. Don't you feel very well, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, my boy, I am all right. I must see
your mother, that is all. I&mdash;I think I used to
know her long ago in England."</p>

<p>"Did you really?" inquired Jack, his face
brightening. "Oh, I'm very glad. Perhaps you
knew our Uncle Jack too, and can tell us where he
lives."</p>

<p>At that moment Betty's voice was heard from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209">209</a></span>
the other end of the piazza. "Here comes mother,
Jack."</p>

<p>Lord Carresford turned his head; took a few
hurried steps forward, and then stood still, gazing
at the figure of the tall lady rapidly approaching
across the lawn. He was very white, but there
was a strange, glad light in his eyes. All unconscious
of the stranger's eager scrutiny the
lady had almost reached the piazza steps before
the sound of Betty's voice caused her to raise
her eyes. Then suddenly her glance met that of
Lord Carresford, and, with a low cry, she started
forward with both hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"Jack," she gasped, "oh, Jack!" And then all
at once her strength seemed to fail her, and she
sank down on the lowest step, shaking from head
to foot, while every particle of color went out of
her face.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Mrs. Bell and Mrs. Hamilton,
who were spending a pleasant morning together
in the latter's room at the hotel, were
startled by the sudden and violent opening of the
door, and the precipitate entrance of Lulu and
Winifred, both hatless, breathless, and almost beside
themselves with excitement.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, mamma," cried Lulu, flinging
herself upon her astonished mother, "the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210">210</a></span>
wonderful, exciting, extraordinary thing has
happened! Lord Carresford is kissing Mrs. Randall
on our piazza, and she's got her arms round
his neck, and is laughing and crying both at the
same time. We don't know what it all means,
but we told Aunt Daisy, and she said we'd better
come for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211">211</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>UNCLE JACK</h3>

<p>"I think it's the most interesting thing that
ever happened in all our lives," remarked
Lulu in a tone of conviction. "To think
of Lord Carresford's turning out to be Betty's own
uncle, and we never knowing a thing about it."</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon, and the two little
girls were sitting in their favorite spot on the
bathing house steps, discussing the events of the
day.</p>

<p>"It is very interesting," said Winifred, with a
little sigh of content. "It's really quite like a
book thing; don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Just as interesting things happen really as
they do in books," said Lulu with superior wisdom.
"Aunt Daisy says truth is stranger than
fiction, and she ought to know, because she writes
books herself. Lots of interesting things have
happened to us, but I don't think anything was
ever quite so wonderful as this one."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212">212</a></span></p>

<p>"I should think Betty and Jack would be just
crazy. I know I should be if a lord turned out to
be my uncle, especially if he were as nice as Lord
Carresford."</p>

<p>"Just think," said Winifred reflectively, "the
Rossiters said their mother was surprised we were
allowed to be so intimate with Betty, because we
didn't know anything about her family. Won't
they be surprised when they hear all about it. I
don't suppose the Randalls will be any different
now they know they've got a lord for a relation,
though it would be enough to make some people
rather stuck up; don't you think it would? You
remember how stuck up Elsie Carleton was that
time her uncle's sister-in-law married a duke's
son."</p>

<p>"Bother Elsie Carleton," retorted Lulu with
scorn. "Betty isn't that kind of a person, or
Jack either."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they'll go to England and
live in a castle?" Winifred inquired in a rather
awestruck tone.</p>

<p>"I suppose so; Lord Carresford is dreadfully
rich, you know, and if he shouldn't ever happen to
get married, why, Jack would inherit his title,
and be a lord too."</p>

<p>"He'd rather be an artist, I think," said Winifred,i<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213">213</a></span>
"or a general, like his grandfather. Oh,
here they come; now they'll tell us all about it."</p>

<p>There was certainly no appearance of lofty superiority
about the Randalls, as they came hurrying
along the sand, Betty pushing Jack's go-cart
as usual, and their greeting to their friends was
very much as it had been that morning, before
they had, as Lulu expressed it, "found out they
had a lord for a relation."</p>

<p>"We're so awfully glad you've come," said
Lulu joyfully, helping Jack out of the go-cart,
while Winifred hastily improvised a seat for him
in the sand. "We wanted to go over to see you,
but mamma and Mrs. Hamilton said we mustn't.
They thought your mother and Lord Carresford
might have a great many things to talk about, and
wouldn't want us around."</p>

<p>"They've been talking all the afternoon in
mother's room," said Betty, "and Jack and I
stayed out on the piazza, but a little while ago
they called us in, and told us about everything.
You can't think how pretty mother looks; her
eyes are just shining, and she's got such a lovely
color in her cheeks."</p>

<p>"I should think she would be glad," said Lulu
comprehendingly. "Does it feel funny to be so
very rich, Betty?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214">214</a></span></p>

<p>Betty laughed and blushed.</p>

<p>"We're not so very rich," she said modestly.
"We shouldn't have been rich at all, only that our
grandfather was sorry just before he died, and
wanted to make another will, and leave some of
his money to mother. He told Uncle Jack, and
he was very glad, and sent right off for a lawyer,
but our grandfather, who was very ill, didn't live
till the lawyer came. But Uncle Jack promised he
would try to find mother, and make it all right
about the money. That's what he came to this
country for, but, you see, the trouble was he didn't
know what part of America father and mother
had come to. He didn't even know that father
was dead. Mother never heard Lord Carresford's
name until she saw him, standing on your
piazza, but even if she had she wouldn't have
known he was Uncle Jack, because she had never
heard of the other two Lord Carresfords being
dead."</p>

<p>"I think it's the loveliest thing I ever heard of,"
said Winifred, "just think, Jack, you'll live in
a castle with a park, like little Lord Fauntleroy."</p>

<p>"And mother won't have to work any more,"
said Jack, with sparkling eyes, "and Betty will
be a lady when she grows up, the kind of lady I<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215">215</a></span>
wanted her to be. Oh, I'm so happy, I feel as if
I should like to fly."</p>

<p>"When father and mother first came home
from California I used to think it must be a
dream," said Winifred, "but it was all true, and
so is this lovely thing about your Uncle Jack."
And Winifred slipped her kind little hand lovingly
into that of her friend.</p>

<p>Jack gave the small fingers an appreciative
squeeze.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing I'm sorry about," he
whispered shyly, "and that is that when we go to
England to live we won't see you any more, not
unless you come over there to see us some time."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall," said Winifred hopefully.
"If we do will you ask us to stay at your
castle?"</p>

<p>"Of course, and&mdash;I say, Winnie, when I grow
up&mdash;I shall be able to walk like other people then,
you know&mdash;I'll come over here to see you, and&mdash;and
I'll marry you if you want me to. I like you
better than any other girl in the world except
Betty."</p>

<p>"There's mother beckoning to me; I must go
right away," exclaimed Winifred, starting to her
feet, and looking extremely red. "Good-night,
Jack; good-night, Betty and Lulu." And away<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216">216</a></span>
flew the little girl, never pausing or looking back
until she was safely at her mother's side.</p>

<p>"I wonder what made Winifred leave in such a
hurry," remarked Lulu, looking after her friend
in some surprise, but Jack did not offer any explanation.</p>

<p>"Well, Jack, my boy," said Lord Carresford,
joining his little nephew on the boarding house
piazza that evening after dinner, and laying his
hand affectionately on his shoulder, "what makes
you look so serious? No more difficulties about
drawing lessons, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Jack, I'm so very happy; I was
just thinking how beautiful everything is, and I
was wishing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what were you wishing?" his uncle
asked smiling, as Jack paused.</p>

<p>"Only that everybody else in the world might
be happy too."</p>

<p>"Rather a big wish, isn't it, my boy? but your
mother and I have been talking things over just
now, and we have a plan, which I think may give
some of your little friends pleasure. You know
you are to leave this house the day after to-morrow;
now where should you like best to go?"</p>

<p>"On board the yacht," said Jack unhesitatingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217">217</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, that is just where we are thinking of
going. I want to take your mother for a short
cruise to the coast of Maine, and I propose that
we invite the Bells and Hamiltons to go with us. I
believe Dr. Bell and Mr. Hamilton both talk of
taking vacations next week."</p>

<p>Jack's eyes danced with delight.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, with a sigh of deep content,
"that it would be the very nicest thing that could
possibly happen."</p>

<p>That evening Lord Carresford had a long talk
with his friends Dr. and Mrs. Bell, the result of
which was that three days later "his lordship's"
yacht was gliding smoothly out of the harbor,
bound for the coast of Maine, and carrying on
board four very happy children.</p>

<p>"When I said I wished I could go to sea in a
yacht the day we were shipwrecked, I never
dreamed it would really happen," remarked Lulu,
surveying her new surroundings with an expression
of intense satisfaction. "I think it's really
quite remarkable the way things happen sometimes."</p>

<p>"I wish your mother and aunt could have come
too," said Winifred a little regretfully. "I don't
believe anybody could really be seasick in this
lovely place."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218">218</a></span></p>

<p>"It isn't always as smooth as this," returned
Lulu, remembering past experiences of Father
Ocean. "You see it isn't very comfortable for
people to go on yachts when they are apt to be
seasick. Mamma and Aunt Daisy were both
dreadfully seasick when we went to Europe."</p>

<p>"I hope you won't be homesick," said Betty
anxiously. "You haven't ever been away from
your mother before, have you?"</p>

<p>"No, but I sha'n't be, I know. It's only for a
week, and I'm going to write her a letter every
day, and one to Aunt Daisy too. Then I've got
papa, you know, and Mrs. Hamilton is going to
take care of me."</p>

<p>"And no one could possibly be homesick with
my mother," added Winifred, with an adoring
glance at Mrs. Hamilton, who was sitting near
by, chatting with Mrs. Randall.</p>

<p>"Well, young people, are you having a good
time?" Lord Carresford inquired, sauntering up
to the group.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed we are," came in chorus from
all four voices.</p>

<p>"Come with me to the other side of the boat,
and we'll have a last look at Sandy Hook. Do
you want to come too, Jack?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said the little boy, smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219">219</a></span>
happily; "I'd rather sit here; it's so comfortable."</p>

</div>

<p>Lord Carresford and the three little girls moved
away to the other side of the yacht, and were soon
joined by Dr. Bell and Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Are you happy, Jack, darling?" Mrs. Randall
whispered, bending down to kiss the radiant little
face, when the two were left alone together.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I'm the happiest boy in the
world," said Jack, softly stroking his mother's
hand, and laying his cheek against it. "All the
beautiful things I've ever dreamed about have
come true. I used to think that if I could only
walk I would never wish for anything else, and
now that's happened, and such lots and lots of
other nice things too. We've found Uncle Jack,
and I'm going to be an Englishman and an artist;
and Betty's going to be a lady. Oh, mother, dear,
doesn't it all seem just like a fairy story that's
come true?"</p>

<p>Little Winifred's efforts to find some

<p>In this book little Winifred Hamilton, the
child heroine of "Winifred's Neighbors,"
reappears, living in the second of the four
stories of a New York apartment house. On
the top floor are two very interesting children,
Betty, a little older than Winifred, who is now
ten, and Jack, a brave little cripple, who is a
year younger. In the end comes a glad reunion,
and also other good fortune for crippled
Jack, and Winifred's kind little heart has once
more indirectly caused great happiness to others.</p>

<p>Two orphan sisters, Barbara, aged twelve, and little Hazel, who is
"only eight," are sent from their early home in London to their
mother's family in New York. Faithful Barbara has promised her father
that she will take care of pretty, petted, mischievous Hazel, and how she
tries to do this, even in the face of great difficulties, forms the story which
has the happy ending which Miss Rhoades wisely gives to all her stories.</p>

<p>Rosamond lives in Richmond, Va.,
with her big brother, who cannot
give her all the comfort that she needs in
the trying hot weather, and she goes to the
seaside cottage of an uncle whose home
is in New York. Here she meets Gladys
and Joy, so well known in a previous
book, "The Little Girl Next Door," and
after some complications are straightened
out, bringing Rosamond's honesty and
kindness of heart into prominence, all are made very happy.</p>
